After having a vision of being in Hell, he decides to change his ways, but this doesn't last long. While watching television, he and Brian spot a man that looks like Stewie.

In the future, Chris, who hasn't changed much, is working as a cop and is married to a foul-mouthed hustler named Vanessa. Meg is now called Ron, since she had a sex-change after college.

To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.</p>

                            <p>As the temperature creeps slowly towards 88 degrees, Manny desperately seeks out new ways to stay cool, lest he trigger his "Dave syndrome." Meanwhile an unsympathetic Bernard falls hopelessly in love with Fran's new neighbour, who is unknowingly taking over Fran's apartment.</p>

                            <p>Bernard and Manny can't hear themselves argue because the shop next door is undergoing some round-the-clock construction. The noise drives Bernard, Manny and Fran up the wall. So Fran suggests a holiday. Bernard and Manny find baggage in her luggage. There's nothing in the crisp packet and Manny's pants aren't that easy to fold. Will the customer crack the system? What happens on the riverboat? Just how many monkeys are missing in Canada?</p>

                            <p>The platoon travel to a secret location to be trained at a battle school. After a long train journey and a march in which they get hopelessly lost, they arrive late and end up missing two meals and the third is virtually inedible.

The platoon then have to capture the 'enemy's camp' held by Captain Rodrigues and his men. This task looks impossible but can Mainwaring save the day and win back the respect of his troops?
Meanwhile Walker tries to raid the nearby farm to get food for his starving comrades.</p>

Attempts at Morse code only prompt Hodges to pursue the platoon to get them to 'Put that light out!' and he ends up stranded himself. If that wasn't enough Jones spots a mine has floated under the pier, but does Hodges have a solution that'll 'bowl them over'?</p>

                            <p>Things are really beginning to heat up for Dexter: Doakes' suspicions about him are growing, his victims are escaping, and his body dump site has been found.

                            <p>Dexter sets his sights on a new victim: a murderer so repulsive it seems only fitting that he's a used-car salesman. Dexter's been unable to lie to Rita about his midnight activities, which has her thinking that he's a drug addict. She's threatened to leave him if he doesn't commit to a 12-step program to deal with his supposed addiction. While in this recovery, though, Dexter meets a sexy, mysterious woman named Lila.</p>

He finally accepts the challenge when he slams the door in Mom's face. Dee Dee knows he'll get creamed, so Dexter builds him a robotic arm to help him win the match. </p>

                            <p>Dexter oversleeps and still has to finish his homework along with getting ready for school and eating breakfast, so he creates a helmet that expands thirty seconds into thirty minutes, but realizes that slowing down time is more detrimental than helpful. When he gets everything done, the helmet shuts off. But Dee Dee blocks his door causing him to miss the bus. When Dexter asks Dee Dee why, she replies "Snow Day, school's canceled!". Dexter realizes he did all that rushing around for nothing! </p>

                            <p>Serenity continues to travel through space conducting illegal runs across the star system, which is under the control of The Alliance. A powerful and fearsome mobster named Adelei Niska demands that the crew of Serenity pull a train robbery. The train is carrying medical supplies for a community, and Reynolds and Zoe get held on suspicion. They get free with Inara's help but realize they were tricked and try to return Niska's money. His henchman isn't too happy, but Mal "persuades" the next guy to take the money back. Meanwhile, two blue-handed, black-suited operatives close in on River.</p>

They find one survivor, but things take a turn for the worse when an Alliance ship looking for an unspecified Firefly-class ship with brother-and-sister stowaways shows up and takes them in.</p>

The drop was unintentional but Jayne doesn't turn down the attentions. Meanwhile, Kaylee and Simon dance, River rewrites Book's bible, and Inara beds the magistrate's son, a virgin.</p>

                            <p>The crew visit the planet Ariel because Inara needs to receive an annual Companion physical. The crew is offered a surprising job by Simon: in return for stolen medicine he wants them to get him into a hospital to use a high-end scanner to diagnose River. Simon devises a plan - Kaylee and Wash browse through the local dump and find parts to make an imitation emergency vehicle so the crew can get into the hospital posing as EMTs. Simon and River pose as corpses with the aid of a drug Simon has. While Mal and Zoe round up some medicine, Jayne stays with River and Simon, who are unaware he has ratted them out to the Alliance in return for money.
Jayne rushes Simon through the examination and on the way out Jayne, Simon, and River are caught by the Alliance. Jayne is betrayed by the Alliance and becomes a prisoner himself. They manage to escape as the Men With Blue Hands arrive and ruthlessly execute anyone who had contact with the Tams. Mal and Zoe end up saving their friends and Simon ma</p>

                            <p>Jealous of Zoe's relationship with Mal, Wash insists (thanks to a bit of scheming) that he go with Mal to try to sell some of the medical supplies the crew stole from the Alliance.  In the middle of the deal Mal and Wash are kidnapped by men working for Niska the crime lord, who wants revenge against Mal for the botched train heist.  He tortures Mal and Wash until Zoe shows up offering money in exchange for the prisoners.  Niska says that the money is only enough for one person and Zoe chooses Wash. Wash realizes that Mal's antagonizing him while they were being tortured was to help keep him alive and kicking.  This inspires him to do everything he can to help Zoe rescue Mal from Niska.  The rest of the crew jump on board to save the Captain.
Meanwhile Inara extends her services to a council member.  To the crew of Serenity's surprise, it's a woman. And Simon continues to treat River with some of the medicine he stole but she suffers the occasional relapse as well as displays a penchan</p>

                            <p>After a flashback to Zoe's and Mal's days in the wars six years previous, we cut to the modern day where the Serenity crew is running a salvage operation on a deserted ship and are forced to flee with the cargo when the Alliance show up. Their buddy Badger refuses to buy the cargo so they head off to the rim worlds after picking up three passengers: Book, Simon, and Dobson. En route someone sends a signal to the Alliance and it turns out to be Dobson, an undercover Federal agent, who arrests Simon but is glad to take the whole crew in. He shoots Kaylee before being captured, and Simon forces Mal to flee in return for his doctoring services. When Mal investigates Simon's cargo he finds a naked woman...</p>

The Serenity crew defends a bordello from a gunslinger who got a prostitute pregnant and now intends to collect the child; Mal falls for the bordello's madam.</p>

                            <p>Saffron (from "Our Mrs. Reynolds") returns - after Mal breaks up her current gig, she convinces him and the crew to help out with a ""perfect crime"" that isn't. The crime: go to Bellerophon and steal a criminal's prototype laser gun from his collection. The plan: Saffron and Mal sneak in and dump the gun down the trash, bypassing security, and the Serenity crew grab it from the disposal system. Of course, this is Saffron, and it turns out she's married to the crook, Durran, and plans to double-cross Mal. Things don't work out so well and Saffron strands Mal naked in the desert. Fortunately Mal and Inara anticipated a betrayal and set it up so Inara grabs the gun, leaves Saffron behind, and rescues Mal.
Meanwhile, Simon figures out Jayne betrayed them (in "Ariel") and the two have words.</p>

                            <p>An old war comrade of Mal's and Zoe's, Tracey, mails his corpse to them. He also leaves a message asking them to deliver his body to his family. Some men claiming to be with the Alliance is on the trail of the body and catch up to them demanding the body. The crew can't find anything on Tracey's corpse, but as they prepare to cut it open, Tracey comes back to life. He explains he is smuggling super-organs in his own body. They flee to the planet with the men in hot pursuit and eventually/supposedly agree to give up Tracey. Tracey gets wind of the plan and makes a break for it with Kaylee as a hostage, they shoot him down and Mal reveals they were going to send the officer off since he's out of his jurisdiction and on a personal mission with no authority. Then Tracey dies and they deliver his body for real this time.</p>

                            <p>Tired of being referred to by customers as "Excuse me" Rachel interviews for a job as an assistant buyer at Saks Fifth Avenue. She also sees another side of the usually docile Ross when the girls face the boys during a not-so-friendly game of poker.</p>

                            <p>This is the one where it all began ... Rachel leaves Barry at the altar, meets the gang, and moves in with Monica. Monica, meanwhile, sleeps with Paul the Wine Guy, and Ross is reeling from his divorce from Carol, who has become a lesbian.</p>

                            <p>Carol, Ross's lesbian ex-wife, tells him at work that she is pregnant with his child, Monica nearly has a breakdown when her parents come for dinner, and Rachel finds out that Barry and her maid of honor Mindy, went on her honeymoon.</p>

                            <p>Chandler's reunited with his beloved cigarettes, which the rest of his friends can't stand. Monica dates a man all her buddies love but with whom she's bored. And poor, honest Phoebe can't deal with the fact that her bank gave her one thousand dollars that isn't hers, plus a soda company gives her seven thousand more unwanted bucks after she finds a dismembered thumb in a can of soda.</p>

                            <p>This is the one where Ross mourns the anniversary of losing his virginity to Carol while at a hockey game with the guys. Rachel gets her first paycheck, the girls have a slumber party, and George Stephanopoulos's pizza is delivered to Monica by mistake.</p>

                            <p>Joey gets his big film break when he's hired to be Al Pacino's stunt butt. Chandler has second thoughts about an exotic married woman who wants him to be her sex toy. And Monica tries hard to prove to her friends that she really doesn't have a type-A personality and can be as kooky as the next anal-retentive chef.</p>

                            <p>Just as Phoebe's about to sing miserable folk songs at Central Perk, New York has a blackout. The gang returns to Monica and Rachel's apartment, where Ross is about to tell Rachel he likes her. Meanwhile, Chandler is stuck in an ATM vestibule with Victoria's Secret model Jill Goodacre, whom he desperately tries to impress.</p>

                            <p>Monica and Ross mourn the death of their grandmother Nana, and Monica and Mrs. Gellar come to an unspoken understanding about the relationship between mothers and daughters. Meanwhile, Chandler is irritated by office speculation that he's gay.</p>

                            <p>Monica's first Thanksgiving dinner for the gang burns when they all run to the rooftop to see the runaway Underdog balloon from the parade. Joey wins his first modeling gig as the poster boy for VD. And Ross competes with Susan to "communicate" with his unborn baby.</p>

                            <p>The gang makes and breaks a pact to celebrate New Year's Eve without dates. Ross compensates for his loneliness by getting a roommate - a monkey named Marcel whom everyone adores. Well, everyone except Monica, who can't get past the faeces-throwing thing. And Phoebe faces a difficult decision when she meets a shy physicist who's thinking about giving up a fellowship in Minsk to stay with her.</p>

                            <p>Chandler's romance novelist mum comes to New York to visit him and he's not sure how he feels about it, especially after Joey catches Mrs. Bing and Ross kissing. Meanwhile, Monica and Phoebe compete for the "attention" of Coma Guy, who gets hit by an ambulance after Monica woo-woo's at him on the street.</p>
                            <a onclick="httpGet('/play', 'Friends - s01e11')">Play</a>

                            <p>Everyone knows the sex of Ross's baby (it's a boy), except for Ross, who doesn't want to find out until it's born. Rachel's relationship with Paulo ends after he makes a pass at Phoebe. And though Monica hates him, she sends him off with one of the dozen lasagnas she made for her aunt, who doesn't want them anymore because they've got meat in them. Meanwhile, Chandler and Joey go shopping for a new kitchen table and come home with a Foosball table instead.</p>

                            <p>After Chandler accidentally sees Rachel wandering around topless after her shower, a chain reaction of nudity ensues when she tries to even the score by seeing his penis. Joey finds himself playing parent when he has to decide whether to hide his father's affair from his mom. And no one can stand Phoebe's new boyfriend, an irritating guy named Roger.</p>

                            <p>Monica cooks a gourmet meal for a restaurateur looking for a new chef. Unfortunately, he's stoned and would just as well eat taco shells as her haute cuisine. After working as a data processing permanent temp for five years, Chandler gets promoted to data processing supervisor, then quits. And Ross has a date with a beautiful colleague named Celia and gives new meaning to the term "spanking the monkey" when he brings her back to his place to meet Marcel. Celia wants to meet his pee-pee, but only if he'll talk dirty to her.</p>

At the hospital, Rachel - who has no insurance - cajoles Monica into trading identities so she can use Monica's coverage. When Ursula breaks Joey's heart Phoebe tries to fix it.</p>

                            <p>The gang searches frantically for Marcel, who slipped out of the apartment while Rachel was baby-sitting him.

                            <p>Rachel and Barry start dating again, which is kind of awkward because he's now engaged to Mindy, who wants Rachel to be her maid of honor.

Meanwhile, Chandler goes nuts when a woman he likes won't return his phone calls.</p>

                            <p>As Monica's biological clock ticks away like a time bomb, Carol goes into labor. When Ross and Susan can't stop bickering over who gets to help Carol more, Phoebe drags both of them into a closet to settle their differences - but all three end up getting locked in just as Carol's about to give birth to the baby. And Rachel flirts with an OB/GYN who has a love-hate relationship with women's private parts.</p>

                            <p>Joey's new girlfriend wants to go to bed with him but he can't yet. He's participating in a fertility study. During Rachel's birthday party, Chandler accidentally lets it slip that Ross is in love with her. However, Ross is on his way to China to identify a bone for the museum. Monica is excited about becoming friends-in-law with her roommate but gets defensive when Rachel can't decide about whether she wants to be more than friends with Ross. But when she finally makes up her mind, it may be too late. Returning from China, with Rachel waiting at the gate, Ross is with another woman with whom he is obviously involved.</p>

                            <p>Joey finds out the hard way that it's not wise to boast false things: His soap opera character gets dropped down an elevator shaft. Phoebe helps Chandler bond with his new roommate...much to Chandler's horror. And sexual history dominates the discussion between two couples--Monica and Richard, and Ross and Rachel.</p>

                            <p>The gang is amazed to learn that Phoebe married a gay Canadian ice dancer to help him get his green card. And Ross seeks relationship advice from Rachel after revealing that he and Julie have yet to consummate their relationship.</p>

                            <p>When a sexy woman calls the wrong number, Chandler seeks to make the most of the situation. And income issues divide the friends: the well-off Ross, Chandler and Monica versus the not-so-well-off Phoebe, Rachel and Joey. This all changes, however, when Monica is accused of taking kickbacks and fired.</p>

                            <p>Joey buys a big screen TV and two leather recliners with his newfound money.  He and Chandler then spend a day refusing to leave the chairs.  They even have food delivered to the girls apartment so they don't have to answer the door. Monica has a catering job for a friend of her parents, the attractive Dr. Burke.  She ends up kissing him the next day at an un-needed eye exam and though there is a 21-year age difference between them, they begin dating. Ross and Rachel attempt to have their first real date, but Rachel laughs every time they kiss. When they try again the next evening, they are interrupted when Ross is called into the museum.  It's too late to go to the restaurant so they have a picnic in the planetarium and end up waking up the next day naked in the display area with a group of Catholic school children looking in.</p>

When Ross finds the bump, he assumes that it was Rachel's fault, but she rats out Monica.  Ross then gets to torture her by pretending Ben is seriously injured.

The friends tie together a bunch of chopsticks into a giant poking device that they use to prod Ugly Naked Guy.  He turns out to be alive and not very happy about being poked.</p>

                            <p>Joey doesn't tell the gang about his plans to throw a party on the roof of the building.

Rachel and Monica go the party and act like crazed fans while Ross is intimidated by Charlie's former boyfriends.  Meanwhile, Chandler is at a play alone.

                            <p>Ed leaves Winry in the custody of the military to catch up with Al. Meanwhile, as Bradley continues to chase after Ling and Lan Fan, Gluttony goes after Scar. As Ed rejoins Al in his fight against Scar, Gluttony arrives on the scene. Ling then joins the fight, and is able to capture Gluttony by using his regenerative ability against him. Lan Fan manages to escape Bradley by cutting off her disabled arm to throw off her blood trail. Riza arrives and drives off with Ling and Gluttony, keeping it secret from the military. As Ed and Al are about to apprehend Scar, they are stopped by May Chang, who uses her alchemy to escape with him. However, Ed and Al manage to take custody of her panda, Xiao Mei. As they arrive back at HQ, they tell Winry everything. She feels depressed, believing all she can do is wait, but feels better when she receives a call from her customers back in Rush Valley. As she goes on the train back, Winry thinks she may be in love with Ed. Ed and Al later join up with the others at a hideout, where Lan Fan's wounds are treated. Ling reveals to Ed, Al and Roy that Bradley is a Homunculus. When Gluttony hears mention of Roy, the one who killed Lust, he transforms and blows the corner off the hideout.</p>

                            <p>Ed and Lin find themselves in a dark place, realizing they're inside Gluttony's stomach, and try to find a way out. May is worried about Xiao Mei, explaining to Yoki about their circumstances, so Scar decides to help search for her. Ed and Lin are approached by Envy, who explains that Gluttony was a failed attempt at recreating the Door of Truth and there is no exit. Envy also reveals he was the one who started the Ishbalan war, before transforming into a giant beast. Meanwhile, Al gets Gluttony to take him to Father, who is apparently in Central, and Bradley gets leverage over Roy by transferring his men to various headquarters and assigning Riza as his personal assistant, effectively making her his hostage. </p>

                            <p>Ed and Lin face off against Envy, and Ed finds himself hesitating to attack due to all the people embedded into Envy's body and gets swallowed. Meanwhile, Scar and May find Shao May with Al and Gluttony and decide to follow them down to an underground tunnel, fighting off several chimeras. Ed spots the Philosopher's Stone inside Envy and manages to figure out a way to escape from Gluttony after seeing the missing piece from the ruins of Xerxes. Bradley explains to Roy how he was trained from birth for leadership and was injected with the Philosopher's Stone. Using various pieces of the Xerxes ruins found in Gluttony's stomach, Ed reluctantly uses the souls inside Envy's stone to transmute himself and open the Door of Truth to escape through. Ed finds Al's body but is unable to bring it back since it isn't his. However, before the Door closes, he bursts through yelling to Al's body that he will come back to get him someday. </p>

In the same time, he faces a demon identical to him talks to him about the humans' weakness, as the story so far is recapped. In the end, Hohenheim finds encouragement from a young Trisha, and he wakes up to discover it was all a dream as a result of drinking too much alcohol. </p>

                            <p>Alphonse and Gluttony arrive at Father's lair, when Ed, Envy and Ling burst out of Gluttony's stomach. Alphonse, Edward and Lin then battle Father and the homunculi. Father then uses his strange powers and turns off Ed's and Al's alchemy, rendering them vulnerable. Lin is then captured and given the Philosopher's Stone, turning into Greed. Scar and Mei then arrive and engage in battle, during which Xao Mei reunites with Mei and Scar finds out about Envy's murder which triggered the Ishbalan Civil War. At the end of the battle, Gluttony dies and Father extracts his Philosopher's Stone.</p>

                            <p>Envy leads Ed and Al, who has sneaked May in his armor, out of Father's hideout, which is actually under military HQ, to meet with Bradley. Ed threatens to quit the military, but Bradley says he will kill Winry if he does. However, he allows Ed and Al to continue their research. Roy enquires if Bradley was the one who killed Hughes, which he wasn't. After checking Winry is alright, Ed and Al encounter Greed, who gives them a message to Lan Fan from Lin. Meeting up with Bradley, Greed points out that Lin is still fighting for control. Roy reveals Bradley's identity to Armstrong, and ponders that there may be another homunculus hidden in the shadows. Al passes on Lin's message to Lan Fan, as well as telling her about him and Greed, encouraging her to get an automail arm. Ed, hearing that other alchemists alchemy had failed the same time as his and Al's, wonders how Scar and May's alchemy works. Meanwhile, as Father creates a new copy of Gluttony, Scar encounters Marcoh in their prison, who begs him to kill him so the homunculus cannot use him for their plans. However, Scar demands to hear more about the Ishbalan war from him. </p>

                            <p>30.) The Ishvalan War of Extermination</p>
                            <p>Years ago, Roy's desire to become a state alchemist is disapproved of by his teacher, Berthold Hawkeye, Riza's father. Before he died of an illness, he asks Roy to look after Riza, who has an alchemic symbol on her back. In the present, Ed visits Riza to return the gun she gave him and asks about Ishbal. After the war broke out, Bradley passed a document announcing the extermination of the Ishbalans. This takes it toll on many alchemists, including Roy which isn't helped by the taunts of Kimblee, who enjoys killing. As Marcoh tells Scar his side of the story, he reveals that he was involved in using Isbalans to make the Philosopher's Stone, which was given to the state alchemists to enhance their alchemy. The Ishbalan leader tried pleading with Bradley to end the killing in exchange for his life, but was rejected. When the war finally ended, Roy resolved that he would work to become the new Fuhrer to protect the people and appointed Riza as her second-in-command. Riza mentions to Ed that when they finally achieve peace, they may have to be punished for the people they have killed. When Envy checks Marcoh's cell, he finds nothing left but a beheaded corpse and the word "vengeance" written in blood on the wall.</p>

                            <p>Ed passes on what Riza told him to Al, and the two contemplate about what to do after they complete their objectives, and as to why Scar and May's alchemy worked when their's was blocked. However, May had run off, so they go and look for her. Meanwhile, Riza, Breda, Fuery and Halman say their goodbyes as they are sent to different HQs, with Roy finding a hidden message inside a chess set Halman gave him. Roy later reminds Ed that he owes him 520 cenz, but Ed decides to keep ahold of it until he becomes Fuhrer. Roy uses the note he got from Falman to make contact with Grumman. Meanwhile, Fu is shocked to find Lan Fan had lost her arm, and declines Ed's help to find an automail mechanic, since it would involve his acquaintances in their troubles. Afterwards, Knox gets a visit from his children, who are pleased to hear he's been able to successfully treat patients. Realising that Marcoh had escaped along with Scar, Envy releases Kimbley from prison, giving him to the task to retrieve Marcoh and kill Scar. Wanting to find out more about Kimbley and the secrets behind his brother's alchemy, Scar destroys Marcoh's face so it won't be recognised, before heading off to the North to recover his brother's notes. </p>

                            <p>As May heads off towards the North with one hooded person, Scar escapes with another to the West. General Grummon, disguised as a woman, meets up with Roy to discuss current matters. Upon hearing that Grumman saw May at the train station, Roy asks Armstrong to pass the message onto Ed, who had decided to look in the library for information on alkahestry. Upon passing on the message, Armstrong also gives Ed a letter of introduction to pass onto General Major Armstrong, his sister. Later on, Ed and Al meet Bradley's adopted son, Selim, and are invited to his house where they also meet Bradley's wife and are later joined by Bradley himself. After the meeting, Ed and Al head off towards the North. Meanwhile, Scar and his accomplice escape from the train heading West, and Kimblee tries to predict his next move. </p>

                            <p>Upon entering the fortress, Ed and Al are taken to the medical room where Ed is treated for frostbite. One of the workers reveal that the northern automail used by Buccaneer is made of aluminum and carbon, and Ed's normal steal automail does not work well in the cold. The brothers then are visited by Olivier who demands the brothers tell her about their intentions. The Elrics tell Olivier about their quest to get their bodies back and their search for May, but they don't talk about their dealings with the homunculi. Olivier knows that Elrics are hiding something from her, but she agrees to help search for May and also orders the brothers to go to work, since there's no food for the lazy.</p>

                            <p>After Olivier comes up with a plan to stop Sloth, Buccaneer forcefully recruits the Elrics and Falman for the plan. With everything in place, Olivier and her trio of tanks ram Sloth into the elevator which is sent down to the level with the exposed walkway. The confused Sloth walks out of the elevator and immediately gets fuel spilled onto him by Buccaneer's group and is pushed over the railings with a combined effort from Olivier's tank, Falman, and the Elrics. The fuel spilled onto Sloth is cold weather fuel that evaporates even in the middle of winter, and with blizzard conditions outside Sloth is quickly frozen. After freezing Sloth, Olivier orders Buccaneer to put the Elrics into the fort's holding cells so she can question them later. The next morning, the Elrics are thanked by several soldiers for helping during Sloth's invasion, but the soldiers still wouldn't let the Elrics out of their cell.</p>

                            <p>Hoenheim recalls when he left the Elric's house, lamenting that his body would outlast his family's. Meanwhile, soldiers investigating the tunnels under Briggs find themselves killed by a mysterious shadow. Lt General Raven tells Olivier to put Sloth into the tunnel and seal it off. Whilst Miles stalls Kimblee for time, Olivier kills Raven. As Olivier enters the tunnel via a separate entrance, Kimblee brings Winry over to see Ed and Al, reminding them of their place. Meanwhile, Scar reunites with Marcoh and Mei, and Roy gets information and a message from Olivier from his intel sources. </p>

                            <p>Winry fixes up Ed's automail before Kimblee talks with him, ordering his men to keep Al separated from him. Olivier sends a search party down the tunnels, who find a couple of survivors warning them not to put any lights on. Riza learns that Bradley's son, Selim, is a homunculus named Pride who attacks from the shadows. Kimblee orders Ed to search for Scar and Marcoh and create a bloody crest similar to Ishbal in Briggs, tempting him with a Philosopher's Stone if he accepts. After telling Al and Winry all about it, he grudgingly accepts the job, though doesn't intend to use the stone himself. As Ed and Al go to search for Scar, their real intent to find May as well, Winry decides to accompany them. </p>

                            <p>Riza gets a call from Roy, but is unable to say anything in fear of being watched by Pride. In the town of Baschool, Ed and Al, along with Winry, lose the guards that were assigned to them and end up running into May and Marcoh. Meanwhile, Scar encounters a couple of Kimblee's men, a pair of chimeras, and runs into trouble with them. Scar gets pinned, but Ed and Al arrive and beat the chimeras, before restraining Scar themselves. Winry and Miles arrive, and Winry confronts Scar face-to-face about her parents' deaths. Explosions then take place and it appears that Scar has taken Winry hostage. Meanwhile, as Olivier's squad retrieve the survivors from the tunnels, Briggs is approached by some people. </p>

                            <p>When faced with the option of judging her parents' killer, Winry decides to heal Scar's wounds, knowing it would be something her parents would do. Miles explains to Scar that he joined the military to gradually change the way people think of Ishbalans. Since Marcoh and May need Scar to decipher his brother's research, Miles offers to hide everyone at Fort Briggs, with Al insisting on sparing the two chimera. While Marcoh and company head for Briggs via tunnels in the mines, Winry comes up with rouse to make it look like Scar has kidnapped her to elude Kimblee just before a blizzard sets in. However, as Marcoh's group heads for the fort, Miles gets word that Olivier is no longer at Briggs and the fort is being manned by Central people. Al goes into the blizzard to find Marcoh's group and warn them. While in the blizzard, Al briefly sees his body, and wonders if it is trying to get its soul back. Meanwhile, Father makes plans involving Ed, Al, Hohenheim, Izumi, and one more candidate. </p>

                            <p>Olivier goes to Central, where she admits to killing Raven and convinces Bradley to let her take his place. Riza uses a coded message to tell Roy that Selim is a homunculus. Meanwhile, 'Father' dreams of ancient Xerxes, where Hohenheim was raised as a nameless slave. There, Hohenheim met Homunculus, a being in a flask who was created from his blood, which gave Hohenheim his current name and taught him the basics of alchemy. One night, Homunculus was summoned by the King of Xerxes, who asked Homunculus to tell him the secret for immortality. Homunculus tricked the king into making a gigantic transmutation circle, using the whole country as a sacrifice, while it and Hohenheim stood at the center of the circle. When Hohenheim awoke, everyone else in Xerxes was dead, except for Homunculus. It created a body shaped like Hohenheim for itself, becoming 'Father.' Back in the present, after Hohenheim awakes from this shared dream, he runs into Izumi and Sig. When Hohenheim notices Izumi's sin, he rearranges her organs so that her blood can flow better. After this, Hohenheim tells Izumi and Sig that he is a Philosopher's Stone in human form. </p>

                            <p>Miles and his men set off with the intent of killing Kimblee and his henchmen, something Ed objects to. As Scar's group exits the mine, they find Al, who warns them about Central infiltrating Briggs, so Scar decides to take them towards an Ishbalan slum. Miles' group attempts to snipe Kimblee, but Kimblee has already figured out their intent and uses a cover of snow to enter the mines. Ed tries to follow, but is attacked by two more chimeras. Ed disables them by using the ammonia in dynamite to make a stink bomb to overwhelm their high sense of smell. Ed then knocks the Philosopher's Stone out of Kimblee's hand, but Kimblee uses another Stone hidden inside his mouth, sending Ed and the chimeras down a mine shaft and leaving Ed impaled by a steel bar. At the same time, Al starts to drift out of consciousness, saying his soul is being drawn back to his body. Determined not to die, Ed gets the chimeras to remove the bar while he sacrifices some of his life span to temporarily fix the wound and to stop the bleeding. The chimeras find the Philosopher's Stone that Kimblee dropped, and, thankful for their rescue, decide to take Ed to a doctor. </p>

                            <p>Briggs is able to defeat the Drachman forces with ease, finally carving out the blood crest. Zampano brings Envy to Marcoh, where Marcoh reveals that it was their intention from the start to lure the homunculus out there, and Envy is easily hit and outsmarted by the multiple alkahestry traps set up by May. Out of anger, Envy transforms into his true form and begins to attack the group. After being captured by the homunculus, Marcoh destroys Envy's Philosopher's Stone and renders Envy into a tiny, parasitic creature. Scar gives it to May and tells her to return to her country. Marcoh and Scar decide to go their own way, and Al and the rest head for Liore. In Dublith, Bido, the last remaining chimera of Greed's, sees two military officers searching for Izumi. Thinking that they could lead him to Greed, he hides underneath their car. Olivier is told about Briggs's victory, and is then shown, by one of the military's higher ups, the secret behind forbidding human transmutation. Meanwhile, when reaching Liore, Al and co. meets with Rosé and Hohenheim. </p>

Meanwhile, Darius, one of the chimeras who helped Ed after he had been injured, goes to a bank and makes a withdrawal from Ed's State Alchemist research account. However, the military is informed and they storm the clinic where Ed and the chimeras are, though the trio manages to escape from them. Hohenheim tells Al the truth about himself and his involvement with Father. While Olivier is shown the army of artificial humans created by the military, Bido is spotted by Greed. Bido realizes who he is and tries to make him remember his chimera friends, but Greed ends up killing him. Angered at seeing Greed kill one of his friends, Lin's conscience has a vicious clash with Greed's. Later that night, Greed storms King Bradley's mansion and confronts him in front of his wife and Selim. </p>

Meanwhile, Olivier requests that her father, leading to fight with Alex to determine leadership of the household, which she inevitably wins, mainly as a means to avoid the family being taken as hostage. May passes through Youswell, who offer to help her on her journey to Xing. Envy manages to trick her into heading back towards Central. Ed, Darius and Heinkel arrive at one of the old hideouts, and are soon met by Lin, who had managed to temporarily regain control over his body. He tells Ed that Father will try to open the gate on 'The Promised Day' before Greed takes over again. Since Greed had severed his relationships, Ed suggests that he becomes his ally. Greed jokes that he'd only accept if they work for him, but Ed decides to take that suggestion seriously, which Greed agrees to.

                            <p>Some Briggs soldiers escort Winry back home, where she is surprised to find Ed and his group. He warns her to escape to another country, but declines, saying Ed should just make sure he protects everyone. Meanwhile, Scar has recruited several Ishbalans to help in his cause and Roy informs Olivier about Selim. Al, who had been suffering from more frequent blackouts, is ambushed by Gluttony and Pride and captured. On the day before the promise day, Bradley is tricked into taking a train back to Central and is caught in an explosion on the bridge. Meanwhile, Riza, Breda and Feury prepare for tomorrow. Also, within the military, as the "chosen" generals are panicking over Bradley's possible death, Olivier sees her chance to try and take control, but before she could do anything, she is halted by the sudden appearance of Father and Sloth. </p>

                            <p>47.) Emissary of Darkness</p>
                            <p>Ed and his group go to see Hohenheim, who tells them about the promised day. Ed also tells Hohenheim Trisha's last words to him. As Ed and his group leave, they run into Al, but after a warning from Lin, it is revealed he's being controlled by Pride. Pride gets the upper hand, but Ed responds by blacking out the slums, taking away the light to form Pride's shadows. Heinekel uses this opportunity to find and attack Pride, but Ed, Greed and Darius are attacked by Gluttony. Having a disadvantage in the dark, Greed switches with Lin who uses his homunculus detection abilities to fight Gluttony. As Gluttony starts to use his full power, he is overwhelmed by the arrival of Lan Fan, who is equipped with new automail.</p>

                            <p>48.) The Oath in the Tunnel</p>
                            <p>Lan Fan and Lin fight Gluttony, and Heinkel continues to fight Pride. Meanwhile, Roy visits Madam Christmas to confirm that Selim Bradley is in fact a homunculus. Pride manages to get back the upper hand in the fight and wounds Heinkel. However, before Pride can finish him off, Ed intervenes and saves Heinkel using his northern automail, now carbon-reinforced. Spies from Central are shown to have followed Roy to Madam Christmas's bar, and as they find out that the madam is Roy's foster mother, the bar is blown up by Roy, who escapes through the sewers with Madam Christmas. Roy then meets up with his subordinates before they attempt to take over Central. Pride takes over Al again, but right before he fights Ed through Al, Fu throws a flash bang into the air, overwhelming the shadows with light and breaking Pride's control of Al. Darius then takes Al away to a safer place, and Gluttony stumbles upon Pride and Ed's fight. Upon discovering that Lan Fan and Lin can sense homunculi, Pride consumes Gluttony, both to replenish his lives as well as to gain a sense of smell that can detect Ed and his group. Pride then smells Hohenheim, who has met up with Darius and Al. Back in Central, Mustang begins his upheaval plot by capturing King Bradley's wife.</p>

                            <p>Ed, Greed, and Lan Fan have a difficult time fighting Pride, who gained Gluttony's powers after devouring him. Working with Hohenheim, Al allows himself to be captured by Pride in order to grab him so that Hohenheim can trap Pride in a mountain of soil where there is no light, preventing him from using his shadows. Meanwhile, Kimblee begins to move just as Scar's group is told about the bombing of Bradley's train. As the Promised Day begins, Greed goes to Central on his own while Ed's group and Scar's group meet up again to devise a plan. In Central, Roy and his subordinates begin to attack soldiers while using Bradley's wife as a hostage. However, the military higher-ups give the order to kill everybody in the group except for Roy.</p>

                            <p>As Team Mustang and Mrs. Bradley gets cornered by Central soldiers, Team Charlie, Mustang's old Ishbal squadron, intervenes and saves them. Team Mustang continues their attack on Central without killing anyone. Meanwhile, the Briggs soldiers lead by Buccaneer join the battle. Soon Team Mustang begins to run low on ammo, and they are saved by an ice cream truck driven by Rebecca and Maria Ross. Mustang calls whoever ordered Ross to return from Xing, and he is surprised to hear Havoc at the other end. During all of the chaos, Ed's group manages to sneak in underground through the Third Lab, where they split up. Ed, Scar, Darius, Zanpano, and Jelso go in one direction while Hohenheim and Lan Fan go in the other direction. However, at that moment, one of the Generals awakens the Army of Immortals.</p>

                            <p>Dr Marco is in the custody of the homunculi, and has to cooperate in exchange for his village's safety. Meanwhile, Ed, Al and Roy try to escape from Gluttony, who has become able to swallow anything in his sights. After losing him, Roy and the others leave to safety whilst Ed, Al and Lin stay to fight. Envy arrives to stop Gluttony from harming Ed and Al. Hearing this, Ed and Al face Gluttony whilst Lin faces against Envy. After some struggles on both ends, Gluttony ends up accidentally swallowing Ed, Lin and Envy. Roy goes to a meeting and ends up confronting Bradley and realizing what Hughes meant. Ed wakes up in a strange room, covered in blood. </p>

                            <p>Still on Scar’s trail, Kimblee figures out that he headed north and follows him there. When Kimblee gets word that Scar and Marcoh are on a train, he boards it by having another train run alongside it, but instead of finding Marcoh, he finds Yoki there. Kimblee is then attacked by Scar, and the two recognize each other from their previous encounter years ago. Before Kimblee can really do anything, Scar impales him with a metal pipe, and this leaves Kimblee no choice but to use his alchemy to separate the two parts of the train, with Scar on the other part. Realizing that something happened, the train’s operators stop it and find the injured Kimblee, but he orders them to keep going. Unbeknownst to Kimblee, the real Marcoh is heading north on foot with May Chang. The two eventually reach the shack where Scar’s brother’s research is located, and they find it intact.

                            <p>As Marcoh and May try to decipher Scar's brother's notes, Al, who had been taken apart to make him easier to carry, regains consciousness. As they put him back together, May figures how to arrange the notes, which reveal the nationwide Amestris transmutation circle. After further investigation, they find another transmutation circle used for alkahestry. Meanwhile, Kimblee encounters Pride, who tells Kimblee to carve out the Briggs blood crest. Elsewhere, Falman gets into contact with Breda, and Sloth finishes digging the tunnels. Hohenheim arrives in Liore, where Rose and the other citizens are rebuilding, and finds an underground passage under the church of Leto. As he stumbles upon Sloth's tunnel, he is attacked by Pride but manages to escape outside its boundary, and then tells Pride to let Father know he would be coming. Meanwhile, in order to carve out the blood crest, Kimblee conspires with Drachman forces to attack Briggs, and Zampano informs Envy of Marcoh's location. </p>

As Ed's group arrive at the door where Al had fought against Lust, the mannequins emerges from the door and they turn out to be immortal indeed. Meanwhile, Olivier is attacked by Sloth, who had been ordered to kill her. Al and Heinkel learn too late that Pride had been sending a secret message from banging on Al's head and are soon attacked by Kimblee, who frees Pride from his imprisonment. In the sewers, May is also being attacked by mannequins and when Envy manages to merge with them, he is able to return to his regular form. As Olivier struggles against Sloth, Alexander rescues her and joins the fight. Al transmutes his legs off in order to help Heinkel, who then gives him the Philosopher's Stone that Kimblee previously discarded. Al uses it to restore his legs and face Pride and Kimblee.</p>

                            <p>Al begins using the Philosopher's Stone to battle against Kimblee and Pride. He manages to trap Pride once again, but is taken by surprise by Kimblee when he starts using his own stone. Meanwhile, as the Armstrong siblings start to gain the upper hand over Sloth, Sloth begins to use his true strength and reveals himself to be the fastest homunculus. Although Al gets apprehended by Pride again, Heinkel, having been healed by Marcoh, manages to deliver a fatal blow to Kimblee. Yoki arrives to rescue Al and the others and head towards Central, while Pride consumes Kimblee. As Alex manages to temporarily impale Sloth on a spike, both he and Olivier are attacked by Mannequin Soldiers. Meanwhile, May fends off both Envy and the Mannequin Soldiers, and Ed's group, overwhelmed by the soldiers, are joined by Roy and Riza.</p>

                            <p>Mustang's team has Mrs. Bradley interviewed on live radio. With the power of radio and the help of the Ishbalans, word of a supposed coup d'état spreads, giving the rebels support from the citizens, while Briggs launches an attack on Central HQ. Meanwhile, Roy manages to destroy the Mannequin Soldiers surrounding Ed's party by burning them to ash. May lures Envy into a trap in the upper levels, causing them both to fall below into the chamber with Ed's group. Envy reveals that he was the one who killed Hughes, infuriating Roy who seeks to get revenge. Ed's group moves onward as Roy fights Envy, but Ed gets concerned that Roy may end up being consumed by his own hatred. Envy is no match for Roy and flees for his life. Upon seeing Riza heading towards Roy for backup, Envy gets an idea. Roy later encounters Riza, who aims a gun at his back.</p>

                            <p>Riza sees through Envy's disguise as Roy and shoots him until the real Roy arrives and mercilessly incinerates the homunculus, reverting him back to his parasitic form. Before Roy can kill Envy, Ed, Riza, and Scar persuade him to let go of his anger and his need for revenge, for Amestris cannot be ruled by someone consumed with hatred. Envy becomes outraged by Roy's change of heart and rants about why everyone does not kill each other, trying to goad them into doing so by pointing out all of the terrible things they have done to each other. Ed determines that the reason Envy hates humans is because he is jealous of their capacity to continue living on, despite all the abuse they take. Humiliated and insulted by how Ed understands him, Envy commits suicide by tearing out and destroying his own Philosopher's Stone. Meanwhile, the Armstrong siblings begin to gain the upper hand in their battle against Sloth; Izumi arrives in Central, allied with Briggs soldiers, to participate in the coup; and Hohenheim confronts Father alone.</p>

                            <p>The Armstrong siblings' and the Central forces' battle against Sloth rages on until Izumi appears and effortlessly pummels the homunculus, who is tossed and impaled on a spike by Alex and Sig, finally killing him. The Armstrongs and Curtises continue on around Central Command to wipe out the remaining mannequin soldiers, with Hohenheim and Father battling underground. With a majority of Central command captured, the Briggs forces are seemingly victorious until when King Bradley suddenly reappears, alive and unharmed, to overturn the coup and retake control of the country. </p>

                            <p>56.) The Return of the Führer</p>
                            <p>Hohenheim, who had managed to converse with all the souls within his Philosopher's Stone, had infused the souls into Father's body to destroy it from the inside. However, Father shows his true form and is able to survive outside of his container. Meanwhile, Bradley begins his attack on Central HQ and single-handedly takes on the resisting forces, as well as destroying Buccaneer's arm. As he reaches the main gate, he finds himself against Greed, and Bradley reveals his hidden Ultimate Eye to fight him. Buccaneer allows himself to be stabbed in order to take away Bradley's sword, though Bradley soon arms himself with daggers. Meanwhile, Falman and the remaining Briggs soldiers try to fend off the Central army, and Fu later arrives to assist Greed in facing Bradley. </p>

                            <p>Greed, unable to hurt Bradley, is pinned down during their fight, which forces Fu to fight Bradley alone. Fu attempts to perform a suicide attack to kill Bradley using explosives strapped to his chest, but Bradley defuses them and mortally wounds Fu. However, Buccaneer thrusts a sword through Fu's body before he falls and successfully stabs Bradley in the stomach, allowing Greed to further harm him, while Lan Fan arrives to witness her grandfather's death. Meanwhile, Ed's group encounters the doctor who created Bradley, and are pit against the numerous rejected Fuhrer candidates. The doctor then activates a transmutation circle, connected by the five research labs in Central, and absorbs Ed, Al, and Izumi.</p>

                            <p>Lin and Bradley's fight leaves them hanging over the side of the front gate, but Lin is saved by Lan Fan while Bradley falls into the moat below. As Buccaneer lays dying, he gives his final request to Lin to defend the front gate. Already distraught by Fu's death, Lin complies and draws upon the full power of Greed's Ultimate Shield to annihilate all Central forces before the gate. Underground, Ed, Izumi, and the unconscious Al reappear in Father's lair to find Hohenheim subdued. With four of the five human sacrifices, Father is left to wait for the fifth. The gold-toothed doctor in the levels above decides to use Roy as the candidate for the fifth sacrifice, has Riza's throat slit and tells Roy that he will only save her if he performs human transmutation. </p>

                            <p>Following Riza's eye signal, Roy refuses to perform a human transmutation. May arrives with Zampano, Jerso, and Darius and heals Riza's wound. However, Bradley and Pride also appear and force Roy to perform a human transmutation anyway, using the gold-toothed doctor as a sacrifice. Roy passes through the Gate of Truth and reappears in Father's lair with Pride, Father, and the other sacrifices, and finds he has lost his eyesight in exchange. Scar battles Bradley above, and May crashes through the ceiling of Father's lair to find Al unconscious. Al stands before the Gate to find his body, but despairs that he will be unable to use it to fight alongside the others because it is so frail. He promises to return for his body and goes through the Gate, regaining consciousness in Father's lair and completing Father's count for the five sacrifices. </p>

                            <p>Ed and Al battle against Pride while May tries to take on Father. Meanwhile, Ishbalans make plans within the city. In his fight against Bradley, Scar reveals a reconstruction transmutation circle from his brother's research now tattooed on his other arm. Just as Ed's group start to gain the upper hand and despite the arrival of Greed, Father grabs the four sacrifices and uses them, along with Hohenheim, for his transmutation circle, absorbing all the souls in Amestris. This opens a giant gate flat on the surface of the Earth from which rises a giant Father. Then another gate opens in the sky with a giant eye looking out which Father calls "God" and pulls towards him. </p>

                            <p>61.) He Who Would Swallow God</p>
                            <p>Everyone closest to the center of Father's nationwide transmutation circle, including Ed's group, survives to discover that Father has used the souls of over fifty million Amestrians to suppress God within a new, youthful body. Father neutralizes everyone's alchemy, but, before he can annihilate them, Hohenheim reveals his countermeasure: he had spent years traveling the country, placing fragments of his own Philosopher's Stone into the earth to use as foundation for returning the Amestrian souls to their bodies. The stone fragments are activated by the eclipse's umbra, and the souls are ripped from Father's body back into their original bodies, which weakens Father to the point of barely being able to suppress God anymore. The eclipse then lifts, blinding Bradley with sunlight and allowing Scar to kill him. Scar activates the nationwide alkahestry circle his brother and fellow Ishbalans had been preparing, which restores everyone else's alchemy at their greatest potential. Facing the full strength of his opponents' attacks in his unstable body, Father retreats aboveground to find more souls and replenish his stone supply. Ed remains behind to fight Pride while everyone else chases Father. Pride tries to steal Ed's body to replace his own unstable one, but Kimblee's soul reappears within him and taunts him while Ed enters his body and destroys it, reverting him to the form of a small fetus-like creature. Ed spares Pride's life and leaves to join his friends. </p>

                            <p>Hohenheim and the others stop Father from making Philosopher's stones, but as Ed rejoins them, Father spawns humans resembling the people of Xerxes before attacking with a powerful blast which takes out half the headquarters. They barely manage to survive the blast, but Al and Hohenheim take some heavy damage protecting the others. Before Father can kill Ed and Izumi, the Briggs soldiers, along with several of Ed's allies, join up to attack Father and use up his stone supply. Father lets down his barrier temporarily to try and absorb Greed's stone, giving Ed, Alex and Izumi the opportunity to damage him to the point of defending himself manually. As Father starts to lose control, he creates a blast which traps Ed's arm whilst his automail arm is destroyed. With Ed in danger, Al convinces May to help him perform a transmutation, trading his soul for the return of Ed's right arm. Al rejoins with his body on the other side and with his arm returned, Ed frees himself to unleash a series of blows on Father. </p>

                            <p>While being effortlessly pummeled, Father desperately tries to absorb Greed's Philosopher's Stone. Greed decides to part from Lin's body, and uses his carbonization ability to turn Father's body into weak charcoal. Father extinguishes Greed's soul, killing him, but Ed punches through Father's chest, releasing all the souls of the people of Xerxes and sending Father to the Gate of Truth where he is trapped for eternity. In the wake of Father's defeat, everyone mourns Al's sacrifice. Ed rejects using a Philosopher's Stone to bring him back to life, even after Hohenheim offers his final life as an apology for the pain Ed and Al were forced through. Ed ultimately decides to perform a human transmutation on himself, sacrificing his own Gate and his ability to use alchemy with it. As a reward for discovering he doesn't need to perform alchemy, Ed is allowed to bring Al back with him in his original body. As everyone recuperates from the battle, Hohenheim returns to Resembool and dies peacefully before Trisha's grave. </p>

                            <p>Deciding to help sort out Ishbalan policies, Roy is approached by Knox and Marcoh, who offer him a Philosopher's Stone to get his eyesight back, with Roy insisting it be used to fix Havoc's legs first. Olivier secretly rescues Scar so that he can assist Miles in rebuilding Ishbal. Having previously seen off Lin, who had promised to take care of May's clan among others once he becomes emperor, Ed and Al return to Risembool where an overjoyed Winry awaits them. Two years later, Grumman, who had become Fuhrer, visits Bradley's wife, who had been raising up Selim to be a compassionate child. Al decides to travel with Jerso and Zampano to Xing and other eastern countries to learn about alkahestry, whilst Ed learns what he can in the west, hoping to pool their research together. As Ed heads off, he and Winry finally express their love to each other using confusing terminology.</p>

                            <p>Professor Farnsworth sends the Planet Express to find a statue of his crew for the 50th memorial service honoring their disappearance. They end up going through the Bermuda Tetrahedron and find a ton of lost spaceships - including the original Planet Express! They look around the ship and a 4D whale comes by and eats the old ship and the statue. Leela makes it her mission to kill the whale and get revenge, which makes them late for the memorial. Eventually, the whale eats the Planet Express ship and the whole team. The only person who escapes is Zoidberg, who returns to Earth in an escape pod. While inside the whale, Leela meets the original captain of the ship, Lando Tucker, who is now attached to the whale's stomach. Leela ends up being able to control the whale and steers him back to Earth to attend the memorial. Leela coaxes the whale to spit everything out, including the statue and the original crew and kills the whale.</p>

                            <p>Ned Stark, Lord of Winterfell learns that his mentor, Jon Arryn, has died and that King Robert is on his way north to offer Ned Arryn’s position as the King’s Hand. Across the Narrow Sea in Pentos, Viserys Targaryen plans to wed his sister Daenerys to the nomadic Dothraki warrior leader, Khal Drogo to forge an alliance to take the throne.</p>

                            <p>Having agreed to become the King’s Hand, Ned leaves Winterfell with daughters Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn stays behind in Winterfell. Jon Snow heads north to join the brotherhood of the Night’s Watch. Tyrion decides to forego the trip south with his family, instead joining Jon in the entourage heading to the Wall. Viserys bides his time in hopes of winning back the throne, while Daenerys focuses her attention on learning how to please her new husband, Drogo.</p>

                            <p>Arriving at King’s Landing, Ned is shocked to learn of the Crown’s profligacy from his new advisors. At Castle Black, Jon Snow impresses Tyrion at the expense of greener recruits. Suspecting the Lannisters had a hand in Bran’s fall, Catelyn covertly follows her husband to King’s Landing, where she is intercepted by Petyr Baelish, a.k.a. “Littlefinger,” a shrewd longtime ally and brothel owner. Cersei and Jaime ponder the implications of Bran’s recovery; Arya studies swordsmanship. On the road to Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys finds herself at odds with Viserys.</p>

Jon takes measures to protect Sam from further abuse at Castle Black; a frustrated Viserys clashes with Daenerys in Vaes Dothrak; Sansa imagines her future as a queen, while Arya envisions a far different future. Catelyn rallies her husband’s allies to make a point, while Tyrion finds himself caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

                            <p>Incensed over news of Daenerys’ alliance with the Dothrakis, Robert orders a preemptive strike on the Targaryens that drives a wedge in his relationship with Ned. A captive Tyrion helps Catelyn, but receives a cold reception at the Eyrie from her sister, Jon Arryn’s widow Lysa. Sansa is charmed by the dashing Ser Loras Tyrell, a.k.a. the Knight of Flowers. Arya overhears a plot against her father.</p>

                            <p>Reinstated as the Hand, Ned sits for the King while Robert is on a hunt. Ned issues a decree that could have long-term consequences throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

                            <p>Explaining that the future of the Lannisters is at stake, Tywin presses Jaime to “be the man you were meant to be” as they prepare for battle. Ned confronts Cersei about the secrets that killed Jon Arryn. With the fate of the missing Benjen very much on his mind, Jon takes his Night’s Watch vows, though not with the assignment he coveted. After Ser Jorah saves Daenerys from treachery, an enraged Drogo vows to lead the Dothraki where they’ve never gone before. An injured Robert takes pains to ensure an orderly transition at King’s Landing.</p>

Jon lashes out at Ser Alliser Thorne and battles a mysterious attacker from beyond the Wall.

                            <p>With Sansa's life in danger, Ned makes a fateful decision. Catelyn brokers an unsavory deal with the slippery Walder Frey. Tyrion acquires a mistress and is forced by his father to fight on the front lines. Robb wins his first major victory and captures a prized prisoner.

                            <p>As tragic news spreads across the Seven Kingdoms, Bran and Rickon share a prophetic dream, Catelyn interrogates Jamie about her son's fall, and Robb's destiny is forever changed. After a surprising decision by his father, Tyrion heads south. Arya assumes a new identity in an attempt to escape King's Landing, and Sansa is terrorized by Joffrey. At the Wall, Jon is forced to choose between the Night's Watch and the family he left behind. Across the sea, Dany pays a terrible price for her love, but finds new hope.</p>

On the island of Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon plots an invasion to claim his late brother’s throne, allying himself with the fiery Melisandre, a strange priestess of a stranger god.  Across the sea, Daenerys, her three young dragons, and the khalasar trek through the Red Waste in search of allies, or water.  In the North, Bran presides over a threadbare Winterfell, while beyond the Wall, Jon Snow and the Night’s Watch must shelter with a devious wildling.</p>

After nine years as a Stark ward, Theon Greyjoy reunites with his father Balon, who wants to restore the ancient Kingdom of the Iron Islands.

                            <p>When a city councilman's body is found in a parking lot, intertwined with a tree, the artistry and missing organs suggest the work of the Chesapeake Ripper. Jack and the team race against time to catch the Ripper while he's still on his killing spree. When Will suggests the possibility that the Ripper is filling his pantry with the victims' organs, Jack crashes Hannibal Lecter's dinner party to collect evidence and test the meat for human DNA. Jack's growing suspicions drive Alana even closer to Hannibal, believing he is the victim of a witch hunt. Meanwhile, clues from the tree man help the BAU zero in on a location they believe the Ripper used.</p>

                            <p>When Jack Crawford’s star pupil Miriam Lass is found alive, she becomes the FBI’s best hope to identifying the Chesapeake Ripper, but her foggy memory complicates the search. Evidence found at the site of Miriam’s rescue exonerates Will Graham of any involvement in the Ripper and Copycat cases, and he is released from the asylum. Will warns Dr. Chilton that he could be in danger due to his intimate knowledge of the Ripper case, but when Chilton tries to confide in Jack that he shares Will’s fears about Hannibal, he is rebuffed — no evidence has been found against Hannibal, despite the FBI’s efforts. Meanwhile, Jack wastes no time in reinstating Will on the BAU team as they hunt for the Ripper.</p>

                            <p>When a young woman's body is discovered inside of a horse, Hannibal suggests to Jack that Will be brought in to help crack this peculiar case. Will has seemingly cast aside his suspicions of Hannibal, resuming their doctor-patient relationship, but Alana remains skeptical regarding Will's true intentions and worries that Hannibal may still be in danger. The FBI questions the man they suspect to be the killer in their case, but lack of evidence forces them to let him go. Will and Hannibal race to guard the safety of a witness they believe is in jeopardy, but it might be Will's own judgment that is in peril.</p>

                            <p>The FBI is called in to investigate the discovery of a truck driver's body, seemingly torn apart by two separate species of animal working in tandem, neither of which consumed their kill. After one of his therapy sessions, Will meets Hannibal's strange new patient, Margot Verger. Will and Margot compare notes on Hannibal and his unconventional advice. Continually encouraging his patients to revel in what they are, Hannibal aims to determine Will's true self by sending him a test, the results of which surprise even Hannibal.</p>

                            <p>The bond between Hannibal and Will grows after Will demonstrates his willingness to go to dark places, a shift that does not go unnoticed by Jack. Jack and the FBI team investigate a tableau made of Randal Tier and his animal exoskeleton, fully realized as the vicious hunter he yearned to be. </p>

                            <p>The truth of Freddie Lounds’ disappearance is discovered by Jack and his team. Alana expresses her concern over Will’s mental state, but he confuses her fears by encouraging her to arm and protect herself. Mason Verger suspects that his sister, Margot, is plotting to usurp him by getting pregnant with an heir. Hannibal reveals to Will how much Abigail reminded him of his sister, making it even harder for Will to understand why she had to die.</p>

                            <p>In a therapy session, Will imagines how he would kill Hannibal, honestly sharing his visions, and oddly bolstering their co-dependency. Later, in a session with Mason Verger, Hannibal discusses Margot’s unfortunate “accident” and other veiled threats. Jack grows impatient with Will’s progress on catching Hannibal, and brings in a surprise witness from the past to help. And when Hannibal’s life is threatened, Will must decide whether to come to his aid, and give Hannibal the opportunity for revenge.</p>

                            <p>Hannibal prepares for his imminent departure with, he believes, Will. Will prepares for a departure of another sort, tying up loose ends, not sure if he’ll survive the trap he’s set for Hannibal. Both men feel that Jack deserves the truth, but what is that truth? Loyalties will be tested and forgiveness will be asked… and the inevitable battle between Hannibal and Jack is upon them.</p>

                            <p>The FBI's search for elusive serial killer Francis Dolarhyde intensifies as Will Graham begins envisioning himself in Dolarhyde's tormented psyche. Wading deeper into dangerous territory, Will enlists the help of Hannibal Lecter to assist with the killer's profile. Meanwhile, Alana Bloom reminds Will that the last time that he and Hannibal worked together things didn't end well, but Will sees no other option. Elsewhere, a new woman comes into Dolarhyde's life.</p>

                            <p>Carvings symbolizing the Great Red Dragon, retrieved from crime scenes, help Will Graham and the FBI shed light on Francis Dolarhyde's disturbing psychology. Meanwhile, Dolarhyde finds ways to communicate directly with Hannibal Lecter  regarding his "becoming." Will feels his bond with Hannibal growing uncomfortably stronger, and seeks out Bedelia Du Maurier, the only other person who fully understands the complexities of such a relationship.</p>

Certain that Hannibal Lecter can lead the FBI to Dolarhyde, Alana Bloom offers Hannibal a chance at redemption. Meanwhile, Dolarhyde struggles with his feelings about the one good thing that remains in his life-his coworker Reba. </p>

As Will's empathy for Dolarhyde begins to affect his fragile psyche, Bedelia Du Maurier warns that the killer Will should be most concerned about at the moment is himself. Meanwhile, Dolarhyde senses that the FBI is closing in and launches a horrifying endgame. </p>

Upon learning of his plan, Bedelia Du Maurier voices concerns that Will's actions may not only put his life in peril, but the lives of those around him. As the end draws near, Will remains unflinching in his game with Hannibal — even when it means coming face-to-face with his own darkest fears. </p>

                            <p>03.) The Obsessive Scientist</p>
                            <p>The narration describes the story of Doctor Genus, brilliant young scientist with ideas of artificially evolving humanity becoming disillusioned with the world, eventually discovering the secret to immortality and creating multiple clones of himself. Saitama cuts off the narration in his impatience and Armored Gorilla then explains that Doctor Genus wants Saitama for his experiments. Genos and Saitama decide to attack immediately, since the store discount day is the next day. Before they leave, Genos asks Armored Gorilla about any cyborgs active four years ago that have destroyed any towns, which Armored Gorilla denies. In preparation for Saitama's arrival, the House of Evolution sets traps in their facility and reluctantly decide to release Asura Rhino. Once they arrive, Genos destroys the above-ground facility with a single blast before heading underground. The released Asura Rhino fights with Genos, taking no damage in the process. Asura Rhino then faces off against Saitama, but backs off when he detects how powerful Saitama really is. Saitama then reveals to the room his somewhat mundane daily training regime of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and 10 km of running, much to Genos's disbelief. Asura Rhino unleashes his Asura Mode and appears to be beating Saitama back, but it transpires that Saitama was just shocked by the realization that the store discount day was that day instead of the next and defeats Asura Rhino easily, leaving soon after with Genos to catch the rest of the discount day.

                            <p>In episode 5 Saitama and Genos are finally going to become registered heroes, but first they have to pass a physical and written test in order to prove that they worthy of being a hero. Saitama easily surpasses the physical exam and anyone else that took it. Even though he aces the physical exams, he doesn't do as well on the written part where he only passed the entire portion by 1 point, but Genos gets a perfect score on both and is given an S rank. While Saitama is at a C rank which is lower despite him being overall stronger than Genos. Saitama and Genos are the only ones who made it out of all the applicants to actually be in a class where a A class presenter is going to teach the class. Sadly the class A Teacher is too confident in his skills but Genos and Saitama are clearly stronger. Then in class the teacher gets annoyed by Saitama for not paying attention and tries to teach him a lesson, only to embarrass himself. Later that day Genos wants to spar with Saitama because of his newest upgrades. Genos still doesn't believe Saitama's secret training strategy and thinks there must be some other secret that even Saitama himself might not know. Meanwhile Genos is giving it his all in the spar, Saitama is just messing around, not really caring about the fight. So he asks Saitama to give it his all, and right when he does the fight ends without Saitama even hitting him. Then Genos came to realize that Saitama is on another level that even he himself can't pass by just training.p.</p>

                            <p>Jerry goes to the hospital for tests that are worrying him and the Phoenix puts on an alternative comedy night and robot wars. The comedy night proves unpopular with the locals until an upset Jerry brings some students down a peg or to with his own brand of witty one-liner's, this leads to him being offered a job on a cruise ship. Bouncers Max and Paddy clean up on robot wars after pursuading DJ Ray-von to build the robot for the competition, this leads to a disagreement over the prize money.</p>

                            <p>In the final episode of the series, Jerry is relieved to get the all clear from the hospital, and Brian is delighted to get Bolton's yearly biggest show, The Talent Trek Grand Final at the Phoenix after telling the judges that Jerry is in fact dying in order to win the sympathy vote. Jerry then reveals the offer of a job on a cruise ship and considers taking it. As Talent Trek is being staged at such short notice, regular backing band Les Alanos are unavailable and are sacked, being replaced by Right Said Frank, a tribute band to Right Said Frank.  They proceed to make fun out of all the acts while stealing car stereos from the car park on their breaks. This leads to a fight with bouncers Max and Paddy and Brian re-employing backing band Les Alanos. As everyone believes Jerry is dying, Brian takes the opportunity to reveal the results of Jerry's tests and singing it's a celebration as Jerry has the all clear. After the show ends rival club owner Den Perry discards his cigar in the toil</p>

                            <p>The club has burnt down (rival Den Perry did it) and Brian has been barred from holding a licence due to safety shortcuts and insurance fiddles. But, inspired by old mate Hoss Cartwright (Jim Bowen) who runs Blackpool's La Ponderosa, Brian has plans for a revival. He needs the help of his former employees, especially Jerry St Clair, who has been reduced to the role of singing salesman at Asda. Features Bob Carolgees and Spit The Dog hosting a Kilroy-like TV talk show.</p>

                            <p>The Phoenix Club hosts a family fun day in the car park in order to raise the funds to reopen the club. Brian is annoyed that the bouncy castle he ordered has male genitalia hanging off the front of it, but it is transformed into Sammy the snake [a green sheet is thrown over it and it has ""layed two snake's eggs.""] Brin then reveals to Jerry his big pink paradise- a portable toilet with pennny chews in the condom machine and a ball pool made out of some scaffolding covered in bubble wrap and some old footballs from the roof. Jerry is not impressed, especially when he has to dress up as a giant red berry. Some children roll Jerry around in his costume after his opening number, while a friend of Ray Von's paints Young Kenny's face with spray paint. At the end, some mischevious children raise the pressure on the bouncy castle, lifting up the giant inflatable penis , which then exploded, leaving fifteen people with rubber burns that needed treatment in hospital.</p>

                            <p>To get publicity, Brian arranges for the Phoenix Club to be featured on TV show Crimetime (presented by Stuart Maconie), recreating the night of the blaze. It turns into a blatant plug for the club – and features Jerry's performance of Reach For The Stars. Meanwhile, the Chinese cooks are stir frying everything and the seedy Spencer (Daniel Kitson) is hired as a barman.</p>

A new backing band, Right Said Frank are introduced, but axed very quickly after they start breaking into cars. Les & Alan get their job back and everyone's happy. Oh, except Den Perry, who's facing a lengthy prison sentence after unwittenly admitting to burning down the club in Series 1. The audition, there's none, but Ant & Dec, the two stowaways have found themselves on the door.</p>

                            <p>Third technician Dave Lister wakes from stasis to find himself alone aboard the mining ship Red Dwarf, three million years after the end of humanity. His new existence isn’t entirely lonely: also aboard are cowardly hologram Arnold J Rimmer, the ship’s senile computer Holly, and an evolved, self-absorbed descendant of his pet cat. Unfortunately, there’s little left to do in the universe but bicker with his unlikely new friends, make a pig sty out of his bunk and, unwittingly, eat the powdered remains of his former crewmates.</p>

                            <p>Attempting to return to Earth at light speed, the crew experience a bizarre series of flash-forwards to future events. Some are as benign as the Cat breaking his tooth on a robot goldfish, others as disturbing as Lister’s death while performing emergency repairs. Troubled by thoughts of his imminent demise, the slobbish technician receives absolutely no support from his companions, Rimmer revelling in the belief that his fate is sealed.</p>

                            <p>Lister's dream of dating former colleague Kristine Kochanski runs into a big problem: the ship can only revive one hologram at a time - and right now it's Rimmer. Lister knows that his one-time superior will never agree to a brief swap, Rimmer knowing that, with a feisty girl in his place, he'll never be swapped back. Against the odds, Lister hatches a plan that has his rival quaking in his boots: if he passes the company chef's exam, he'll be the ship's commanding officer.</p>

                            <p>Given a copy of the Cat Bible, passed down through generations while the species evolved, Lister makes an incredible discovery: in his absence, he became a god. Dubbed "Cloister The Stupid" by the Cat people, his dream of opening a hot-dog and donut diner in Fiji has given rise to an entire religion. Rimmer, meanwhile, leaps to his own conclusions when the ship recovers a space capsule, believing it to contain an alien lifeform of a race he calls the Quagaars.</p>

                            <p>A mutated form of pneumonia turns Lister's dreams into reality, raining herring upon the crew and summoning the sixteenth century Mayor of Warsaw who promptly explodes. The fever subsides, but not before inviting two unlikely guests to Red Dwarf: personifications of Lister's conflicted personality. Much to the chagrin of the snivelling Paranoia, the larger-than-life Confidence brings Lister closer than ever to finding Kochanski's hidden hologram disc - but at what cost?</p>

                            <p>Lister's attempt to activate a second hologram - his dream date Kristine Kochanski - goes horribly wrong and creates Rimmer's ideal companion instead: himself. Moving into their own shared quarters, the two Rimmers quickly drive both the crew and each other mad, the city-sized Red Dwarf proving too small for such an insufferable pair. Before long, the conflict has escalated to the point where only one Rimmer can survive - and it falls to Lister to decide which.</p>

                            <p>The crew jump at the chance to answer a distress call from a ship crewed entirely by women, only to discover that they’ve been dead for years. Not that it’s stopped their butler, a servile android called Kryten, keeping the place tidy and serving breakfast every day. To Lister’s frustration (and Rimmer’s delight), Kryten’s programmed duties continue in earnest on Red Dwarf, an overactive guilt chip rendering him incapable of dissent. In the end, only Marlon Brando can snap him out of it.</p>

                            <p>A three million year old mail pod drifts into Red Dwarf’s path, bearing the sad news of Rimmer’s father’s death. The grief is cut short, however, by the discovery of “Better Than Life”, a total-immersion videogame that treats players to a hedonistic free-for-all. For the crew, this means fast cars, loose women and limitless wealth, Lister feasting on caviar vindaloos while the Cat dates Marilyn Monroe. How long, though, before Rimmer's neurotic brain stirs up trouble in paradise?</p>

                            <p>The morning after Rimmer’s “Deathday” party, the crew wakes to discover that four days have passed, a mysterious grave marked “To The Memory Of The Memory Of Lisa Yates” having appeared on a nearby moon. Stranger still, Lister and the Cat have both acquired broken legs while someone’s completed the jigsaw puzzle. A black box recorder fills in the gap, recalling tales of Rimmer’s barren sexual past and a misguided attempt at a Deathday surprise.</p>

                            <p>A tear in the fabric of space and time appears on one of the ship’s lower decks, opening a doorway to Earth in the distant past. Arriving three weeks before the Red Dwarf disaster, the crew decide to right the wrongs of history, albeit on an entirely selfish basis. While Rimmer tries talking his former self into cryogenic stasis, saving himself from the catastrophe, Lister makes a beeline for Kristine Kochanski, oblivious to the fact that she’s already married.</p>

                            <p>Holly’s absent-mindedness allows a meteorite to hit Red Dwarf, endangering the crew and damaging Rimmer’s hologram generator. As an emergency measure, the backup computer Queeg 500 takes over the ship, subjecting its inhabitants to a physical and mental fitness regime that drives them to the point of despair. In a last-ditch bid to reclaim control, Holly proposes a winner-takes-all Chess match, despite accusations that his knowledge stems from the Junior Encyclopaedia Of Space.</p>

                            <p>Believing his new “Holly Hop Drive” can return the crew to Earth in a matter of seconds, Holly instead sends them to a parallel dimension with its own Red Dwarf. In this reality, Lister is a beer-swilling tomboy, Rimmer a stilted female bureaucrat, and the Cat, to the horror of his visiting alter-ego, is a dog. In a night they’ll all regret, the crews mingle, the drink starts flowing and one thing leads to another, the repercussions for Lister being unnaturally severe.</p>

                            <p>Under Rimmer’s supervision, Kryten takes a driving lesson at the wheel of Starbug, Red Dwarf’s newly-revealed scout ship. A chance meeting with a wormhole, however, sends student and teacher to a world that literally has everything backwards. Conversations end at the beginning, fights un-blacken eyes, and beer tastes best when vomited into the glass. By the time Lister and the Cat mount a rescue, their crewmates have discovered the bizarre upside of life in reverse motion.</p>

                            <p>Holly’s discovery of “five black holes” in Red Dwarf’s path prompts the crew to abandon ship, Rimmer and Lister crashing on a nearby ice planet when Starbug collides with a meteorite. With hope fading as the days pass, the marooned pair must sacrifice more than just their rivalry to survive, Lister’s diet reduced to dog food and the only thing he hates more: Pot Noodles. The need for firewood, meanwhile, soon imperils their most prized possessions: Rimmer’s camphor wood trunk and Lister’s guitar.</p>

                            <p>An uninvited alien guest brings the worst out of the crew – then eats it. Feeding on the fear, anger, guilt and vanity of its prey, the shape-shifting “Polymorph” creates an even more dysfunctional adversary: their alter-egos. Unable to hatch a plan that doesn’t involve leaflet campaigns and kicks to the balls, the psychotic Lister, placard-waving Rimmer, boorish Kryten and drunken Cat must unite in order to survive, the face of the enemy changing at every turn.</p>

                            <p>Lister asks a malfunctioning dispenser unit for a Toffee Crisp and triggers the ship’s self-destruct sequence, the only way out being a “body swap” with a dead, high-ranking officer. Inspired, Rimmer suggests a two-week trade: Lister’s body for his, the sweetener being that he’ll return it in tip-top physical condition. Unfortunately, the pleasures of the flesh prove too much for the weak-willed hologram, the fitness regime descending into an orgy of binging and self-abuse.</p>

                            <p>Lister’s despair at life after humanity lifts when Kryten, having discovered some mutated development fluid, creates photographs that literally revisit the past. With no regard for the laws of causality, Lister looks to exploit the discovery for his own ends, talking his teenaged self into inventing the “Tension Sheet”, a billion-selling sheet of painted bubble-wrap. Suddenly alone on Red Dwarf, Rimmer is left with little choice but to “save” his crewmate from a life of luxury.</p>

                            <p>The crew intercepts a message from Kryten’s manufacturer, DivaDroid International, declaring him obsolete and announcing his successor, the all-singing, all-dancing Hudzen-10. Left with days to live by an inbuilt self-destruct programme, Kryten reflects on his robot existence, taking solace in the thought of an electronic afterlife. A farewell party prompts a change of heart, however, jeopardised by the arrival of his super-strong, murderously deranged replacement.</p>

                            <p>Lister tries in vain to teach Kryten how to lie, insult, cheat and disobey orders. Lister gives up when Rimmer calls Kryten on a trip "moon-hopping". On the trip they receive a distress call and Kryten goes to investigate against Rimmer's orders (The planet is about to explode).    Kryten rescues a "female" droid called Camille who he falls in love with, even though droids aren't supposed to have feelings like that. Kryten takes Camille back to Starbug, but when Rimmer sees her, she's a hologram who is interested in him. They bring her back to Red Dwarf and then Lister sees a human female with tastes similar to him.    Lister notices how everyone reacts to Camille and she confesses to Lister that she is a Pleasure GELF (Genetically Engineered Life Form) programmed to be everyone's perfect companion. The Cat goes to see, and it is not surprising that he sees himself! The GELF turns into her true form at Kryten's request which is a huge green blob.    Despite her apalling appearance, Kry</p>

                            <p>The crew stumble upon a deserted space ship of non-human origin and Rimmer believes it is an alien ship. They go inside to search the ship and Kryten and Rimmer discover the remains of a three-headed creature. They find a wallet on him with human artifacts such as credit cards, license etc. and Kryten suggests that something has changed his physical form.    Meanwhile, Cat and Lister find a machine with a Star Trek style computer panel. Cat begins playing with it and accidentally traps Lister in a pink beam. A deep voice announces that a transmogrification is about to take place. When Cat tries to get him free, Lister turns into a chicken. Rimmer and Kryten come along and while Cat is showing what he did to Lister, he traps Kryten in the beam. He manages to change Lister back to a human, but when he does the same for Kryten, it actually transforms him into a human, rather than just setting him free.    Back on Red Dwarf, Kryten is delighted with his new-found humanity. However he soon</p>

                            <p>Lister is in bed with "space mumps" when he hears the news that the gang has brought aboard a cryo-pod from a prison ship which possibly contains a guard named Barbara Bellini.
Lister inspects the pod and begins the thawing process, which Rimmer objects to, saying that there were two survivors aboard the ship: Ms Bellini and a Simulant prisoner (Simulants are droids who are noted to be murderous and insane). Since it is too late -- they cannot stop the thawing process -- they decide to travel to the prison colony that the ship was heading for.
They arrive on the space station and walk through a white light which Kryten says is a mind probe to seek out any unpunished criminal activity. Lister gets very edgy and confesses that he had committed some minor crimes as a teenager. 
The justice computer passes his verdict on them: Kryten and Cat get off, Lister does so, but barely. Rimmer, however, is sentenced to 9000 years in prison for the second degree murder of the Red Dwarf's complement of 1167 personnel -- not counting himself or Lister.
Kryten believes that he can defend Rimmer and reverse the verdict and he fronts up to the justice computer, describing to it all about Rimmer's extreme inadequacy and sheer hopelessness. The computer eventually concedes that Rimmer should not have been held accountable for the deaths and releases him due to incompetence.
Meanwhile the pod has thawed and the occupant has escaped. It is, of course, the simulant who was inside and he chases them through the colony. Lister finally beats him by using the power of the justice field - whatever crime you commit against someone else, the consequences happen to you. When the simulant fires at Lister, the bullets hit him instead of Lister, when he throws a knife, it comes back and hits him and so forth.
The gang head back to Red Dwarf with Lister droning on and on about justice and freedom until he falls down a manhole.
"Thank God for that" remarks Cat.</p>

                            <p>An attempt to restore Holly's mind via "intelligence compression" backfires, giving her an IQ of 12,000 but just three minutes to live. With the aid of the infuriating Talkie Toaster, whose questions about life, the universe and everything invariably gravitate towards bread, the crew devises a solution, unaware that a nearby "white hole" is disrupting the passage of time. Alarmingly, it falls to Lister's contested pool-playing skills to put everything back in order.</p>

With Starbug downed after the collision, the daring, dashing Ace Rimmer attempts a one-man rescue, unaware that his doppelganger is, in this reality, an intolerable coward. Neither a broken arm nor hostile, jealous hologram can keep him from his duty, but when the company is this hopeless, even a hero finds it hard to keep his chin up.</p>

With Lister and the Cat imprisoned by, among other villains, the Roman emperor Caligula, Rimmer and Kryten recruit an army of heroes for a rescue operation. Unfortunately, the allied forces of Elvis, Gandhi, Stan Laurel, Pythagoras, and Noel Coward are about as effective as Rimmer's first military command.</p>

They come across a computer-generated ship, and Rimmer is captured and taken aboard. The Holoship (named 'The Enlightenment') will not answer Starbug's communication attempts on account of them being notoriously arrogant and self-centered. Meanwhile Rimmer is having quite a good time aboard the Holoship: he can touch, feel and taste. Not only that, but it's a ship regulation to have sexual relations at least twice a day with any other crew member.    He meets a crew member, Commander Nirvanah Crane who gives him a tour of the ship. Upon having sex with her, He falls in love with her and she, even though they have disposed of the concept of 'love' aboard the ship, feels something for him also.    Rimmer decides he wants to stay aboard the ship, and challenges a randomly-selected crew-member. The crew member turns out to be Nirvanah who lets him win on purp</p>

The crew are flying along in Starbug when they lose control of the ship. Using Lister's body, something announces itself as The Inquisitor and that they will return to Red Dwarf to face judgement. Kryten later describes the Inquisitor as a self-repairing simulant who survived to the end of time to find no heaven or afterlife. So he built a time machine and went back and forth through time, judging everyone on whether they have lead a worthwhile life, deleting the ones who didn't and replacing them with "the sperms that never got a chance".    Back aboard Red Dwarf, the inquisition begins. Rimmer and Cat survive the trial because of their shallowness and low standards, but Lister and Kryten could have made more of their lives and are removed from history.    Just as their phys</p>

Lister comes, collects and "fixes" Kryten. Kryten tells them that Rimmer was captured while on a psy-moon (a terraforming moon that reshapes itself to mimic a persons psyche).    The crew reluctantly go out on the surface to search for him. Rimmer is hung up in a dungeon and prepared to be tortured by The Unspeakable One.    The crew make their way across the Swamp of Despair with frogs that say 'Useless' and through a graveyard with headstones that desribe a positive part of Rimmer's personality that has died: self-confidence, honour, generosity, charm etc. Lister notices a freshly-dug grave with the headstone 'Hope' and Kryten tells the others to hurry, realising that they could be in serious danger if Rimmer loses all hope for himself.    The crew finds the dungeon and drive back the unspeakable one, saving Rimmer. They try</p>

Rimmer objects to Kryten being in charge but is ignored by the others and goes to sulk.    They send a scouter which reports that there is a scientist named Dr. Lanstrom inside the facility. Unfortunately she is a hologram and Kryten asks Rimmer to go back to Red Dwarf so they can rescue her, using another Space Corp Directive against him. Rimmer questions the validity of the Directives that Kryten uses so Holly gives Rimmer a hologrammatical copy of the directives manual, whereupon Rimmer again goes off to sulk.    Going into the research center, they find the Doctor in stasis only to discover that she has contracted a holovirus that has made her insane but has given her extraordinary powers like hex vision and telekinesis at the price of her sanity. They escape when her life force is drained and she disappears, but the disease is transferred to Rimmer.    When the rest of the crew get back on Red Dwar</p>

                            <p>Lister and Kryten have invented a triplicator: a device which can make triples of objects. They demonstrate it on the last strawberry in the universe and recieve two exact copies. Lister samples one and reels from the taste, saying that it is brilliant, so succulent and divine. He tries the other and scrunches his face in disgust as we see that there are maggots crawling around in it.    Kryten notes that the triplicator has put all the best qualities in one copy and the worst in the other. Lister attempts to reverse the process but causes an overload and Red Dwarf blows up. After the blast, they realise that they accidentally triplicated Red Dwarf and there are two copies left behind.    The crew board the "High" ship to find their counterparts are monks and are all into the better side of things: spiritual happiness etc. Kryten finds half of the triplicator he needs to merge the ships to get the original back.    They board the "Low" ship and it is horrible, the crew are monsters and</p>

                            <p>The crew are on an ocean planet investigating a seeding vessel called the SSS Esperanto which was studying the life forms that had been introduced by humans. They find 3 people aboard who committed suicide, and a haddock who did the same. Lister notices an oil covering everything and Kryten suggests that it is a hallucinogenic venom much like the oil from an octopus or squid.    He does a chemical analysis and rushes the others back to Starbug saying that the oil contains a hallucinogen which induces despair, enough to drive the crew of the Esperanto to kill themselves. They try to escape in Starbug to avoid it happening to them, but the despair squid chases them and they crash into a rock. Starbug is destroyed.
The gang wake up to find they were playing a computer game called Red Dwarf for the last four years (and they only scored 4%). Lister is the rich and successful Sebastian Doyle, Rimmer (his brother, Billy) is a bum, the Cat is the saddest geek you will ever see named Dwayne Dibley</p>

Kryten then transfers the virus to his CPU in an attempt to eradicate it.

Lister reluctantly does so but on his wedding night, does a runner back to Starbug. The chief takes this as an insult and releases his pet Emohawk, a smaller polymorph (see Polymorph) on them. The Emohawk hides on Starbug and attacks Rimmer and Cat, taking Rimmer's bitterness and the Cat's cool; turning them into Ace Rimmer (see Dimension Jump) and Dwayne Dibbley (see Back to Reality).   Ace, with his new personality, decides to save the day and locks Kryten and Lister in the hold so they will be safe while he and Dwayne go after the Emohawk. They eventually track it down and freeze it, forcing it to release their emotions and turning them back to normal.</p>

Rimmer, always the brave, jumps in an escape pod but when it releases the ship begins to fall apart. The rest of the crew use the transporter to get back to Starbug and track the pod which is heading down to a planet. Unfortunately, the pod goes through a worm hole on its way causing Rimmer to be on a completely different time stream than Starbug. When he reaches the planet, Rimmer uses technology from the pod to create a woman in his image, but no matter how many times he tries all he can do is clone himself. When Starbug reaches the planet on the normal time stream, 600 years have passed on the planet and the Rimmer clones have taken over, banishing the</p>

They find out they were in an unreality pocket, and Lister is indeed human. More of these unreality pockets pass until they decide to go into stasis until they get through the fog. In the centre of the fog they find a Space Corps derelict which is capable of time travel.    They take the time drive and hook it up to Starbug's engines.

                            <p>After Starbug was destroyed, the future crew no longer existed - therefore were unable to go back in time and kill the present crew, hence they survived.   But unfortunately disaster has struck. Starbug is completely devoid of curries. Lister proposes that they go back in time to order a couple of hundred curries from an Indian Restaurant. The rest of the crew will not go back in time because they are afraid of becoming the future selves they saw. However, Lister removes a guilt chip from one of Kryten's spare heads and swaps them over, telling the new guilt-less Kryten to reassure them it will be OK.    They go back and appear in the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas on November 22nd 1963 just as Lee Harvey Oswald is taking his shot at President Kennedy. They knock him out the window where he dies hitting the ground, preventing Kennedy's assassination.    To avoid being captured they go ahead a couple of years, however Kennedy's survival causes an alternate reality where he has b</p>

                            <p>After traveling through countless realities, Commander 'Ace' Rimmer returns to the Red Dwarf crew to ask a favor of his alternate self. It seems that the real Ace Rimmer died years ago and has been replaced many times over by his counterpart from each reality. This Ace Rimmer will soon die and asks our Rimmer to be his successor as an inter-galactic hero.   After a little push from Lister, which seems to bring the two closer together, Rimmer decides to accept the offer and begins his training. When Ace dies, Rimmer dons his outfit and says his goodbye to the crew before leaving Starbug.</p>

                            <p>Over 3,000,000 years ago in the Aigbuth Arms pub, a box with a baby inside was placed under a pool table with just the word Ouroboros written on the side....    Returning to the present day, the crew come across a wormhole between dimensions. They go through the wormhole, and meet an alternate version of themselves. Rimmer isn't there, Lister is a Hologram, Kochanski is alive, and Kryten is wearing a gold suit. They decide to exchange information and Kochanski requests that Lister fills a canister up with his sperm, so that she may have a child as her Lister cannot bear children. Unfortunately, Lister's in-law's - the GELFs attack (see Emohawk), and cause a break in the wormhole and Kochanski becomes caught on this side.
They eventually manage to escape the GELFs, thanks to Kochanski's navigation. Kryten is jealous because Lister likes Kochanski more then him and is glad when they return to the wormhole to get her back to her own dimension. On a box they found some supplies in, Lister</p>

                            <p>Kochanski is not adjusting very well to being on Starbug and Lister tries to make her feel better by building her a makeshift bathtub and finding some extra clothing for her. Kryten thinks that this means they are growing closer and soon will not need him so he 'accidentally' causes an engine failure, forcing the crew to crawl around in the air ducts to get to the engine room.</p>

                            <p>While Kochanski is still trying to get back to her dimension and Kryten is still jealous of the relationship that she could have with Lister; Lister begins to miss Rimmer and reflects on some of the fun times that he and Rimmer spent together in the early days after the accident. When he has a dream that Rimmer returns and he and Rimmer kiss, Kryten tries some psychology to get to the bottom of Lister's problem. However Kochanski has a little talk with Lister and makes him realise why he misses Rimmer, much to Kryten's disgust. Kryten, having to be one step better than Kochanski, creates "The Rimmer Experience" a virtual reality rollercoaster created from Rimmer's memories, depicting him thinking of himself as a 'Hero' and a 'Remarkable Person', giving Cat fashion tips and believing that Lister has called for Rimmer to save him before he wets himself. As the ride finishes Lister is so angry at Rimmer that Kryten sticks it to Kochanski because his method worked better than hers.</p>

                            <p>Kryten finds a lobster scuttling around the cargo hold and cooks an elaborate feast for the crew as it is the anniversary of when he was rescued from the Nova 5. The rest of the crew however have prepared to enter a virtual reality world of Jane Austen, where Kochanski hopes to teach them a little culture. Kryten is extremely upset that they left without touching his feast and enters the VR world, blowing up the characters of the game with a tank and ordering the crew to supper. Kryten seems to calm down as they tuck into the lobster but Lister asks for a little ketchup to 'pep it up' and Kryten blows his top. Literally.   They replace his head but the rage still flows through him and they eventually run out of spare heads. They go aboard a derelict ship and find some heads but they dont have their primers installed. The crew realise that it is a simulant ship and hightail it, but they cannot leave without the heads so they dress up as GELFs and make a deal with the simulant captain.</p>

                            <p>The crew come across another Jupiter Mining Corporation vessel. Everyone on it is dead except for one person who is preserved in a block of ice. They take her aboard Starbug but the ice doesn't melt, even in very warm temperatures. They decide to leave it till morning to decide what to do. During the night, the woman inside breaks out, covered in rotting skin and dead flesh and climbs into bed with Lister, who believes it's Kochanski. One thing leads to another, but when she kisses Lister, she falls dead, and Lister realises he's just taken about half her face with that kiss.    It turns out it was a virus inside the woman, known as Epideme, who infects it's victims, takes their knowledge, kills them and then preserves the body and waits for another victim. Epideme has now entered Lister. After hours of trying to reason with it, they try to get rid of it by forcing it into Lister's arm and then cutting the arm off. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and Epideme begins to regenerate himself</p>

                            <p>Lister is quite annoyed that his right arm has been cut off, but seems to enjoy Kryten nursing him 24 hours a day; and Kryten is absolutely loving it. Kochanski becomes fed up with seeing Kryten doing things for him that he could easily do with one arm and comes up with a solution - use nanobots from Kryten's self-repair system to rebuild Lister's arm. Unfortunately, Kryten hasn't last seen the nanobots since they had met the Despair Squid (see Back To Reality) They all go into the deep sleep booths and make their way back to the ocean planet.    The computer brings them out of deep sleep and they discover a planet which the Navicomp says is Red Dwarf. They are able to retrieve the original Holly and he explains that the nanobots had deconstructed Red Dwarf, created their own miniscule version of the ship and turned the rest into a planet for safekeeping. They realise that it was the nano version of RD that they were chasing and the nanobots evaded them by coming aboard Starbug and tra</p>

                            <p>Season 8 begins with Lister and Rimmer (who is now alive) in their new sleeping quarters on Red Dwarf. Lister tries in vain to get Rimmer to talk to him and we then flash back to three days earlier:  From where we finished the previous season, Cat pilots Starbug into the Dwarf's landing bay which is now huge. As they fly through an air vent the ship begins to shrink back to it's proper size. When they finally land (or crash) Starbug we learn that the nanobots have resurrected the crew along with the ship. Lister thinks this is a godsend but Captain Hollister promptly arrests him and the others for stealing and then destroying a Starbug.   While confined to his old quarters Lister is met by Rimmer and, after being disgusted that Rimmer has returned to his original smeghead self, pleads with him to help him and the others escape before they are sentenced. The Captain and the other officers are trying to figure out why they are now in deep space.</p>

                            <p>Get Rimmer Officerhood, Power and Eminence (GROPE for short) is in full swing as he sucks up to Captain Hollister using the confidential files Lister gave him. However Rimmer will not help Lister and the others escape until he is promoted. Lister secretly takes some of the Luck Virus and escapes from the holding cell and heads to find his compadres.  Kryten is classified as a woman as he has no apparent genitalia and is put in with Kochanski. This won't last long as the engineers are planning to restore him to his factory settings. One thing he cannot do is say no to a superior officer and this event ultimately happens.  Lister finds Kochanski and the Cat (who is being held in the medical bay while they try to figure out exactly what he is) and the three find the no-personality Kryten. To avoid detection they dress up as the Dibbley family using mop heads as wigs and big, ugly false teeth.</p>

                            <p>Rimmer and Lister are trying to adjust to life in prison given that they are in the worst area you could possibly get. They go on about trying to survive the next two years there as we fade into ... Two Days Earlier:  From where we left off, Lister, Kochanski, Cat and Kryten are dressed up as the Dibbley family and making their escape. What they don't know is that they are hooked up to a VR suite and all of this is a simulation.  They climb aboard a Blue Midget, which is very different to what we have seen before. It is now a large vehicle which stands upright on two massive legs. After a fabulous display from the Cat where he tap dances with the Midget, they make their escape.  Rimmer gets to the VR suite and types a command to erase any references to the deal he and Lister made.  Suddenly the scene aboard the Blue Midget cuts to erase several words and it looks like a bad editing job.  After several moments of jumping around they realise they are in VR.</p>

                            <p>Lister mistakenly signs the gang up for the 'Canaries', prisoners that go into dangerous situations first to ensure it is safe for the important people. Their first mission is to investigate a derelict spaceship, and our crew come across a computer called 'Cassandra' who can accurately predict the future. When she predicts that Rimmer will die when the ship disintegrates, he goes to great lengths to prevent it from happening.</p>

                            <p>Kryten complains to Lister about being placed in the women's wing of the prison and makes the fatal mistake of revealing he showers with them too. The male inmates want him to sneak in a camera and film them but he refuses.  Kill Crazy and some other inmates reprogram him, turning him into a ruthless entrepreneur and he creates "Krytie TV", a pay-per-view service offering "Women's Shower Night" and other events.  Lister tries to get Kryten to stop, as he and Rimmer are in the middle of an appeal against their sentences, but Kryten plays a trick on them, getting them to mistakenly trash Ackerman's quarters live on Krytie TV.</p>

                            <p>Lister and Rimmer are constantly getting into trouble. After playing a practical joke on Ackerman they are forced to play in an inmates vs guards basketball game and win by putting erectile solution in the guards drinks. Punishment for that is to peel potatoes for the next three weeks and to make that go faster they steal a programmable virus to peel them but it ends up eating their clothes and hair. Punishment for that is to spend three weeks in the Hole where they meet Birdman, who has been in there for nine years and has only one friend, a sparrow named Pete.   Meanwhile Kryten, Cat and Kochanski are sent aboard a derelict ship where they find a device which can change the time stream surrounding an object or person to make it move extremely slow or fast and decide to use it to make their prison sentences go by in a flash.  On Red Dwarf they freeze the crew and break Lister, Rimmer and Birdman out of the hold.</p>

                            <p>Our crew desperately try to turn Pete back into a sparrow before the time freeze wears off but Pete eats a scutter who was holding the time wand. The crew put out a heap of food for Pete and he eats it but then runs amok on the ship. Meanwhile the freeze wears off and Rimmer and Lister are hauled in front of Hollister who gives them a long and detailed account of how Pete ate almost all of the ship's supplies and then was sick. The time wand is retrieved and Hollister demands that they turn Pete back to normal. Lister and Rimmer complete the task and destroy the time wand, but they notice all too late that Pete had laid an egg that begins to hatch...</p>

                            <p>An escape pod docks with the Dwarf and is carrying the only survivor of a ship which was attacked by a genetically-engineered corrosive life form. Unfortunately, the corrosive material is also on board and begins to eat away at Red Dwarf.  Meanwhile Lister tricks Kryten into believing that Kochanski's 'time-of-the-month' is an event to be celebrated and he embarrasses himself in front of her. Plotting revenge, Kryten steals four flagons of illegal alcohol from an inmate and leaves it in Lister and Rimmer's cell just before an inspection. Lister discovers the alcohol and he and Rimmer are forced to drink it before their inspection. They only take one mouthful out of the bottle and are immediately drunk.   Meanwhile, the crew learn of the life form destroying Red Dwarf and plan to abandon ship, leaving the prisoners aboard to die.
The gang figure out a way to combat the life form by creating a doorway into an opposite universe and finding the opposite to the corrosive material.</p>

                            <p>18.) My Tuscaloosa Heart</p>
                            <p>J.D. has a patient who's rude to him and the nurses and eventually dies from cancer. J.D. feels awful for not giving him his full attention and worries maybe he could have saved the guy if he was nicer to him.
Meanwhile, Elliot is convinced that Dr. Kelso is the one singing a song called "Tuscaloosa Heart" on a tape given to her by a patient who claims he went to college with Bob. And Dr. Cox finds himself trapped in a love square: He's falling in love with Kristen Murphy, his intern, just as his ex-wife reappears demanding sex – and there's also his crush on Carla.</p>

                            <p>01.) My First Day</p>
                            <p>John Dorian, "J.D." to friends, is a boyishly handsome, self-deprecatingly funny, likeable guy who would be confident if he only realized his assets. Four years of medical school have prepared J.D. for his first day as an intern at Sacred Heart Hospital - but he has his doubts. As J.D. is thrown into the chaotic world of hospital life, we not only get to see the quirky characters that he encounters, but also hear the humorous commentary of thoughts streaming through J.D.'s head. By J.D.'s side is his best friend since college, the handsome and confident Chris Turk. As a new surgical intern, Turk struts around with a gregarious and cocky demeanor that hides a terror that he only admits to J.D. Both guys initially have the hots for their attractive fellow intern, Elliot Reid, but J.D. quickly finds out her beauty is only surpassed by her hyper-competitive attitude. Guiding the interns' education are those with more medical experience. Dr. Robert "Bob" Kelso, Chief of Medicine, wants the interns to think they can count on him. On the other side of the personality spectrum is Dr. Percival "Perry" Cox, a steamroller of a man short on patience. Watching over the interns with a caustically teasing but caring demeanor, is nurse Carla Espinosa, a woman who is motherly and sexy at the same time - which appeals mightily to Turk.</p>

                            <p>J.D. tries to persuade a smoker patient to quit smoking in order to impress Dr. Cox, who is just feeling lonely in his opinion. Elliot's attitude towards Carla annoys her, thus Turk is able to go on a date with Carla, when he convinces her to forgive Elliot.

                            <p>J.D. begins to feel distant from Turk, when he leaves him abandoned every time that he tries to talk to him. Elliot fights with Kelso for calling her "sweetheart," and she seeks Dr. Cox's advice. J.D.'s relationship with Elliot goes in a time race, when he has 48 hours to kiss her before he is put into her "Friend Zone."</p>

                            <p>The three interns are each assigned patients with various illnesses. Statistically speaking, one of the three is going to die. J.D.'s patient is 86 year old Mrs. Tanner, who is in renal failure. 20 year old David Morrison is Turk's hernia patient and Elliot's patient Mrs. Guerrero only speaks Spanish and might have lupus.

                            <p>J.D. points out what seems to be a technical mistake to Dr. Kelso, but it was really an attempt of Dr. Cox to save a woman without insurance using a dead guy's insurance. Dr. Kelso and Dr. Cox show J.D. their different ways of looking at medicine. Meanwhile, the Janitor intimidates J.D., Elliot discovers the healing powers of her boobs and Turk gives Carla a pen he thought he took from the Lost and Found box.

                            <p>Dr. Cox is still facing the threat of suspension, and coincidentally, J.D. is assigned to a special patient: Jordan Sullivan, an important board member. She is very demanding and J.D. ends up sleeping with her after he confronts her. Only he didn't know that she is Dr. Cox's ex-wife, and now the only one who can save J.D.'s mentor from being fired by the evil Dr. Kelso.
Meanwhile, Elliot is assigned to take care of a shrink whose jaw has been wired shut, and for whom she ends up becoming a patient. Carla's mom makes a scandal after Turk spends the night at Carla's, and when she breaks her leg, Carla blames Turk for it.

                            <p>J.D. has finally earned the spot as brightest student, but he's got competition: Nick Murdoch, who seems to be nicer, friendlier and has a better butt than him. But even J.D. can't hate the guy, for he is so nice. But he is surprised when he finds Nick sitting in a corner crying because he can't take the pressure of medical internship.
Meanwhile, Turk is having problems at the operation table and doesn't tell Carla, who keeps bothering Dr. Cox about it.
And Dr. Cox gives Turk a very unique suggestion on how to calm down before surgery.</p>

                            <p>J.D. and Turk become heroes after saving a cameraman's life on TV, while heading to a strip club. But Turk quickly becomes the target of a new publicity campaign led by Dr. Kelso, exploiting the hospital's diversity.
Meanwhile, J.D. worries about his evaluation. Elliot is going out with Carla, but in the last minute she blows her off and later Elliot runs into her in a bar.

                            <p>J.D. gets to see the hospital through the eyes of a patient when he's admitted for appendicitis. Elliot examines him and he tells everyone how cold and rough she is, which drives her crazy. J.D. doesn't want Turk to operate on him, which hurts Turk's feelings.
Meanwhile, Dr. Cox is trying to show off to his mentor, Dr. Benson, the ex-chief of medicine, who is also a patient at the hospital. The only thing in his way is Dr. Kelso, who almost dismissed Dr. Benson prematurely.

                            <p>J.D. begins a new relationship with Carla. J.D. gains a new nickname - "Scooter" - and his relationship with Nurse Carla evolves as he begins to out-distance her medical knowledge, while Turk trembles, when he learns that his secret lunch spot was claimed years ago by the territorial Dr. Kelso.
Elsewhere, Dr. Cox gives Elliot the evil eye when she won't discharge a troublesome patient.

                            <p>It's Christmas, and even though J.D. and the others don't really feel like celebrating, Turk makes a huge deal about it. But his faith and happiness are gone after a very busy night at the hospital.
Dr. Cox has J.D. videotape the birth of the child of one of his friends.

                            <p>A woman slips and falls on the wet floor of the hospital. Afraid that she might sue the hospital, Dr. Kelso asks J.D. to stand by her and be friendly, so she won't sue them. But J.D. is very busy with Dr. Cox's 24-hour marathon to keep his ICU patients alive.
Elliot is desperate for some attention from Dr. Cox. Meanwhile, Turk snaps at Carla when she steals fries from his plate.

In addition, a perplexed Carla and Turk deal with their first sexual intimacy complication.

Meanwhile, Dr. Kelso gives Carla a ride to work and she sees a totally different side of him. Turk develops a conflict with Dr. Cox after he finds out that Dr. Cox has secret feelings for Carla.

Meanwhile, Turk elects to partner with Elliot on a research project so that he can maneuver her back with his buddy J.D., and Carla struggles to fulfill a comatose patient's final request - playing heavy metal music in his room.

                            <p>J.D., Elliot and Turk are receiving their first medical students, and now they finally get a chance to see what it feels like to be on the other side. Turk's student is a very attractive young woman, to whom Dr. Cox is immediately attracted. But he doesn't know his way around women and needs Turk to give him a little help. J.D. doesn't know how to handle his student and Elliot's turns out to the be son of an important CEO.

                            <p>An assortment of moms and dads descend on their offspring at home and in the workplace. J.D.'s father is a gregarious yet lonely divorcee who's desperately trying to be just one of the guys. Elliot's folks, on the other hand, are a snooty couple whose pompous behavior dismays their daughter. Similarly rattled is Turk, unnerved by the bonding of his girlfriend, Carla, and his brassy mother. But the most vexatious parent by far is the janitor's dad.

                            <p>Turk's competitiveness is starting to annoy J.D., especially when it crosses the line of personal jokes and comes to patient's matters.
Meanwhile, Dr. Cox finally has a taste of good coffee, but thanks to his feud with Dr. Kelso, the only nurse who was able to make it gets fired. Elliot meets a very attractive patient, whom she instantly identifies, but has a really hard time getting him to ask her out.

Meanwhile, Elliot has a hard time combining her new relationship and keeping up with studies. Turk obsesses about getting in shape, after Carla makes a fat joke about him.

                            <p>Jordan's brother Ben is admitted at Sacred Heart for having an accident with a nail gun. J.D. learns that Ben has leukemia, but won't believe it, since there have been many mixups in the hospital lately, so he goes on a search for the real test results.

                            <p>Ben takes the news of his diagnosis pretty well - at least better than his sister Jordan and J.D. Remarkably, it is Dr. Cox who is the voice of reason and compassion, until his own fears get in the way.
Meanwhile, Turk and Elliot have their own issues to deal with. Turk is upset because he wasn't chosen to assist on a difficult surgery and Elliot is criticized during rounds by Dr. Kelso for the 100th time.

                            <p>It's J.D.'s last day as an intern, and soon he will become a resident. Carla and Turk are arguing about dating other people. Elliot finally rebels against being everyone's doormat, and J.D. is just trying to stay out of people's way.
Jordan has returned to get a physical and a new patient, Mr. Bober, has been admitted, because he needs his gall bladder removed. He really needs the surgery, but doesn't have the insurance to pay for it. They enlist the help of Dr. Cox, Dr. Wen and Jordan.

He feels guilty for doing that, even though she wants to go ahead with it. Meanwhile, he can't stand listening to any more relationship problems, as everybody dumps their issues on his ears: Elliot, sabotaging her relationship with Paul over beef jerky, Carla, finding out her engagement ring passed through a patient's digestive system and Dr. Cox's unsucessful attempts to get some attention from Jordan, who can only think about her baby right now.

Turk is sleeping on J.D.'s bed, after Carla kicked him out of his own. Elliot is having a hard time facing J.D. every day at work.

                            <p>J.D., Elliot and Turk find themselves alone in the hospital night shift and face responsibilities without supervision for the first time. Luckily, they have Carla there to support and guide them through the night.
Meanwhile, Dr. Cox doesn't know what to do, when he realizes that he has feelings for his ex-wife Jordan and is asked (forced actually) to introduce Dr. Kelso at a social event, where he will be receiving an award from the medical board.

                            <p>When Dr. Kelso challenges the residents by offering a trip to a medical conference in Reno as a reward to the individual, who presents the most interesting case study, J.D. refuses to play along, earning him the respect of Dr. Cox.
In the meantime, Turk misses his opportunity to ask for a new laser on the one day of the year, that Dr. Kelso grants favors, so he is forced to find another way to come up with the goods.

                            <p>J.D. insists that Carla should open up to him. When she finally starts to do that, J.D. screws it up by telling Turk. Elliot is desperate for attention from Dr. Cox. Turk sees himself in an ethical dilemma when Dr. Kelso picks him over a female surgeon to spend a weekend in Mexico.

                            <p>Elliot sleeps with a handsome doctor she hardly knew and soon becomes the hospital tramp. Turk suffers from his back after operating with Dr. Amato, a very short surgeon. J.D. finds out that wearing a white coat doesn't make him a better doctor, but is upset by having Dr. Cox throw in his face that he made another mistake. And Dr. Kelso is just dying for an opportunity to lash out his anger on Dr. Cox.

                            <p>J.D.'s brother is in town. Turk is thrown out of a patient's funeral for not knowing his name and feels even worse because earlier he made a bet with Dr. Cox over another patient's life.

                            <p>All of the male doctors are euphoric due to the visit of Julie Keaton, the pharmaceutical sales rep, except for Dr. Cox, who still believes in treating patients for their best health, instead of trying to get some attention from the hot Ms. Keaton.
Meanwhile, J.D. and Elliot argue over a risky decision regarding one of Elliot's patients. Turk tries to talk Carla into entering a practitioner nurse course, so she won't be so underestimated by the doctor's staff.

                            <p>When an expectant Jordan shows up unexpectedly, Cox is forced to choose between her and his new love, Julie.
Meanwhile, J.D. and Turk take advantage of the hospital's supply closet for sleep, when they take on extra shifts at a free clinic to supplement their income. Carla encourages Elliot to stand up to her father, when he pressures her to pick a specialty more "suitable for a woman."</p>

                            <p>Ever since her father cut her off financially, Elliot's been feeling the weight of the world on her back. While having to find a new affordable place to live, she also has to face the threat of being sued by a patient whom she told he had only eight months to live. Carla and Jordan hit a sore spot when Carla gives her opinion on Jordan and Perry's relationship.
Meanwhile, J.D. has a fight with Dr. Cox and the two dispute over who gets to give the better treatment to two patients with the same prognosis.

Turk and Carla are having romance problems, because she feels he's not being as generous to her as she is to him. And Dr. Cox freaks out when he lets Jordan move in to his place due to her pregnancy.

                            <p>J.D. bonds with a patient, who is waiting for a heart transplant and discusses with her their idea of what death must be like. Elliot puts her foot down and demands a feminine locker room from Dr. Kelso. Turk decides it's time to propose to Carla, but a kid swallows the engagement ring.

                            <p>Turk is still waiting for Carla to answer his proposal and asks his brother to stay over a few days to help him deal with it. Dr. Townshend, an old friend of Dr. Kelso and one of the nicest doctors around befriends J.D.
Elliot accidentally finds out the sex of Jordan's baby, becoming the object of Dr. Cox's anxiety.

                            <p>Elliot meets a nice guy at the bar, but freaks out when she finds out he's a male nurse at Sacred Heart. Turk keeps asking Carla to marry him, but she still won't give an answer. Dr. Cox feels the pressure he puts on himself everyday: His psychiatrist, his subordination to Dr. Kelso and his paternal feelings for J.D.

                            <p>J.D. and Turk think they've got bad karma after hitting a car and causing an accident, while playing golf on the hospital roof. Dr. Cox bends over backwards to give Jordan as much comfort as possible on her labor day, and she confesses to J.D. that Dr. Cox is the real father. Elliot seeks advice from Carla on how to tell Paul that she's crazy, because they're getting more intimate and she can't hide it anymore. But Carla is feeling too crazy herself with the upcoming wedding.

                            <p>Turk takes J.D. up to surgery, and right from the start J.D. steps all over Turk when trying not to be the geek among the surgeons. Paul hears Elliot say "I love U2" while she was rearranging her CDs and thinks she said "I love you too." Dr. Cox decides to get even with Dr. Kelso by telling everyone he's dead, revealing what people really think of him.

                            <p>Jamie's (T.C.W.) husband died, and J.D. struggles with the ethical issues involved in starting a relationship with her. Dr. Cox babysits his son, whom Jordan still hasn't chosen a name for, and is disturbed that he feels nothing for the baby. Turk is haunted by erotic dreams about Elliot, which gets him into hot water with Carla.

                            <p>J.D. carries on with his romance with Jamie, but finds himself at a dead end after realizing she's a drama queen. Dr. Kelso makes Dr. Cox give a class on how to approach the patients nicely in order to prevent possible law suits. Carla's mother dies and she wants to get married.

                            <p>J.D. and Turk's college buddy, Spence, drops by for a visit, and accidentally tells Dr. Cox a secret. Too much partying with successful Spence causes Turk and J.D. to show up late and drunk for work, which Dr. Kelso fully reprehends them for. Elliot's feeling low since she can't measure up to Dr. Kelso's standards, and the Janitor starts another feud – this time over paychecks – with J.D.</p>

                            <p>A run-in with her old flame Sean and an accident in her new car lead Elliot to the realization that nothing good has happened to her in the three years that she has been at Sacred Heart. This realization drives her to take drastic measures, including a complete makeover, both inside and out, in an attempt to change her luck.
Meanwhile, J.D. gets stuck with a patient, whose diagnosis he can't quite pin down, and when Dr. Cox denies him any assistance, he looks to Carla and Turk to help him out. While Dr. Cox is busy not helping J.D., he takes the time to make amends with Dr. Kelso.

Meanwhile, Carla is driven crazy over an unidentified urine sample, and Elliot tries to balance Sean and her career, so that one doesn't end up getting in the way of the other.

Dr. Cox finds the ideal pediatrician for his son: Dr. Norris, who acts and looks just like him. However, Dr. Cox is quick to find a problem with him once Jack develops a cough that scares both him and Jordan.

Dr. Cox. is forced to swallow his pride and actually ask for help when he decides to throw his hat in the ring for the Residency Director position at the hospital.
Carla picks up an extra shift as a surgical nurse, which allows her to spend the day working alongside with Turk, to his great annoyance.

Elliot tries to deal with her own problems of a long distance relationship and decides to try moonlighting as a pet examiner with Carla to save up money.

Carla's brother Marco comes to visit, but he still hasn't forgiven Turk for mistaking him for a valet at their mother's funeral. Unfortunately, Turk can't even apologize because Marco can't speak anything but Spanish.
At the hospital, Dr. Cox relishes his new job promotion but is surprised when J.D. doesn't follow his lead in contradicting Dr. Kelso's orders.

Meanwhile, as they each deal with problems in their own relationships, Carla and Elliot work to find their own balance between their personal and professional relationships.
Dr. Kelso accidentally punctures his eardrums giving the hospital staff an opportunity to tell him how they truly feel about him.

Meanwhile, Dr. Cox crashes at J.D. and Turk's after taking bad advice from J.D. Carla suggests no more sex until the wedding and Turk only comes to terms with it after learning the real meaning of romance from a patient with prostate cancer.

                            <p>Carla and Elliot try to help a patient, Maggie, lose her virginity as she prepares to die.
Walking in on her sister and Dr. Cox prompts Danni to move in with J.D. Dr. Cox attempts to convince Turk to do a kidney transplant for a patient he has "moved up" the list. But a personal grudge seems to stand in the way and may decide whether the patient lives or dies.

                            <p>J.D. believes he may have finally found a mentor in Dr. Kevin Casey, a surgeon with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it turns out that Dr. Cox has always been jealous of the guy.

Meanwhile, Turk and Dr. Cox volley a hypochondriac patient back and forth since there's nothing wrong with him.</p>

                            <p>Laverne and Dr. Cox engage in a philosophical debate. Carla finds a hot nanny for Isabella, and Turk struggles to find a way not to leer at her.

                            <p>Laverne is brain-dead, and her family decides to take her off life support. One by one, the staff say their goodbyes, except Carla, who stoutly refuses to accept what's happening. She consequently finds herself "haunted" by Laverne. Meanwhile, Jordan gives birth, but Dr. Cox doesn't want to tell anyone because he doesn't want his daughter's birthday to always be associated with Laverne's death.</p>

Other people featuring are the Janitor as the giant, Keith as the prince, Dr. Kelso as the dark lord Oslek, Ted as his hunchback and of course Dr. Cox as the brave knight.</p>

                            <p>A war hero, invalided home from Afghanistan, meets a strange but charismatic genius who is looking for a flatmate; it is London, 2010, and Dr Watson and Sherlock Holmes are meeting for the first time. A string of impossible suicides has Scotland Yard baffled - and only one man can help.</p>

                            <p>A mysterious cipher is being scrawled on the walls around London. The first person to see the cipher is dead within hours of reading it. Sherlock plunges into a world of codes and symbols, consulting with London's best graffiti artists. He soon learns that the city is in the grip a gang of international smugglers, a secret society called the Black Lotus.</p>

                            <p>Compromising photographs and a case of blackmail threaten the very heart of the British establishment, but for Sherlock and John the game is on in more ways than one as they find themselves battling international terrorism, rogue CIA agents, and a secret conspiracy involving the British government.  This case will cast a darker shadow over their lives than they could ever imagine, as the great detective begins a long duel of wits with an antagonist as cold and ruthless and brilliant as himself: to Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler will always be THE woman.</p>

Sherlock must fight for his reputation, his sanity and his life. But is he all he claims to be?</p>

But, with London under threat of a huge terrorist attack, Sherlock Holmes is about to rise from the grave with all the theatricality that comes so naturally to him. It’s what his best friend wanted more than anything, but for John Watson it might well be a case of ‘be careful what you wish for’! If Sherlock thinks everything will be just as he left it though, he’s in for a very big surprise…</p>

Mortal danger stalks the reception - and someone might not make it to the happy couple's first dance. Sherlock must thank the bridesmaids, solve the case and stop a killer!</p>

                            <p>While out searching the galaxies for his next paycheck, Dandy and QT make a trip to "Boobies", Dandy's favorite restaurant chain. While scoping out the other aliens, they meet Meow (whom they believe to be a "new species" of Betelgeusian). Shortly after a tussle at Boobies, Meow is taken aboard the ship and effectively "joins" the crew, sharing advice on where they can find rare alien life. However, without realizing it, the three are being followed by Dr. Gel. Luckily, they manage to escape pursuit when Meow foolishly engages their broken warp drive.</p>

They are greeted by Meow's family, who take them in while their ship is repaired. That night, the calendar in Meow's house is struck by a wayward blast of Pyonium energy sparked from a battle between the Gogol and Jaicro Empires, causing the events of that day to endlessly repeat themselves in a time loop.</p>

                            <p>The Aloha Oe crew bring a red box to the alien registration center, believing it to contain a rare alien. They have no memory of how they acquired the box, only knowing that they will not remember what is inside once it is opened. The box accidentally opens to reveal a book that was checked out by Admiral Perry from the library planet Lagado. The crew also finds a complimentary ticket for a free trip to Lagado inside the book. When they arrive at the planet, they are transported to the surface by its resident aliens, who greet the book and ticket as their librarian and deputy librarian, respectively. The book and ticket are revealed to be aliens that record information on their bodies and take control of others' minds, having used the crew to rescue themselves from the Gogol Empire, explaining their failure to recall the event. Before erasing their memories, the book gives the crew another red box as a gift for their help, warning them not to open it early. The crew bring the box to the registration center, where it opens to reveal a videotape that also manipulates others' memories, starting an intergalactic war involving other video and computer storage devices that goes unrecorded in history. </p>

Spurred by previously disregarded feelings of love, QT visits the shop each day and develops a friendship with Maker, also meeting her co-worker, a robotic cash register. One day, QT arrives to find that Maker and the register have been recalled to a seaborne landfill as they have begun exhibiting emotions, causing them to malfunction.</p>

Mr. Burns eventually fires him, so he becomes a department store Santa (again?).  He is in a parade as Santa when Mr. Burns offers him $1,000,000 to pull one more prank.  When Homer refuses, Mr. Burns does it himself, pouring fish guts onto the children.

To gain their life savings back, he sells his body for medical testing.  The doctors find something odd in his head x-ray.  Homer has a crayon lodged in his brain.  This explains why he is such a moron.  He thinks it is because he shoved crayons up his nose as a child.  When the doctors remove the crayon, he gets smarter.  This allows him to bond with Lisa.  In fact Homer proves to be even smarter than she is.  He is so smart that he accidentally proves there is no God.  He also blows the whistle on the plant's nuclear safety violations.  So the nuclear plant has to close and everyone hates him.  He can't find happiness in things he used to like and he can't fit in with the people of Springfield.  He decides to have Moe (a licensed surgeon) shove another crayon into his brain and he goes back to being a blissful idiot.  Lisa understands why he did it and doesn't hate him for it.

The over commercialization of the rebuilt church puts Lisa off; she leaves it for good in search of a new place to worship.  She finds Lenny, Carl and Richard Gere at a Buddhist temple.  Richard gives her some information about Buddhism and she converts.  The family tries to use Christmas as a means to bring Lisa back to Christianity.  Realizing what they are doing runs to the temple but learns from Richard that Buddhism allows for the tolerance of other beliefs.  So as Homer puts it, she can "pay lip service" to Christianity while remaining a Buddhist.

                            <p>The family goes to the library's used book sale; where Homer obtains a copy of Duff's Book of World Records.  When he's gone through all the records, he decides to set one of his own.  Duff tells him that all the personal records have been set.  He needs to help set a group record.  The town tries to set a record for the world's tallest human pyramid; but when they fail, they inadvertently set the record as the world's fattest town, which they celebrate.  Only Marge has a problem with this.  She goes to the Motherloving Sugar Company to lodge her complaint.  The owner Garth Motherloving is less than cooperative, so Marge files a class action lawsuit.  Professor Frink blows the whistle on "big sugar" and the court rules in Marge's favor and then bans all sugar from Springfield forever.  All the town's sugar products are burned and Apu's store shelves are empty.  Apu brings Homer into a group determined to smuggle sugar back into Springfield.  Homer and Bart join with Apu, Mr. Burns, Count Fudgula and Garth Mothelovering in a scheme to smuggle in sugar from the island of San Glucose.  They make it into Springfield Harbor, but are intercepted by the police.  Evading Wiggum and Co., Homer finds himself faced with the decision to either "Dump Cargo" to make Marge happy or "Obey Bad Guy" and bring sugar to Springfield.  He chooses the former, but Judge Snyder realizes that he's overstepped his authority and makes sugar legal once again.

                            <p>The family watches the gay pride parade and then goes to the movies.  Homer loudly protests the fact that the movie hasn't started, due to the length of ads and previews.  When the ushers chase him out of the theatre, Homer runs straight into the glove of a statue of fighter, Drederick Tatum, and breaks his jaw.  With his mouth wired shut and nothing else to do, Homer becomes a great listener and even a respectable member of society, which delights Marge.  After his jaw has healed, Homer continues to be everything he never was before.  On Afternoon YAK he promises to not revive his "weckless, weckless ways".  Weeks later Marge realizes that their life has become dull, so she enters the family car in a demolition derby and soon finds herself in trouble.  In a sequence reminiscent of the "Popeye" cartoons, Homer sucks down a can of Duff and comes to her rescue.

                            <p>Homer's incessant snoring is keeping Marge awake and the cost for surgery to correct the problem is costly.  She moves in with Patty and Selma to get some sleep.  The news reports that Marge's former boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is the 5th richest man in America.  Patty and Selma convince Marge that she should contact Artie, so they send an e-mail on her behalf.  Artie receives the e-mail and reveals his 20-year obsession with Marge.  Artie Ziff flies to the Simpson home and takes them for a ride.  He then makes an indecent proposal, $1 million for Marge to spend a weekend with him, so they she might find out what life would have been like with him.  After another sleepless night, Marge gives it serious thought, after all the money would allow them to pay for Homer's much needed nasal surgery.  Marge goes off with Artie and Homer has second thoughts.  Artie recreates their senior prom and tries to kiss Marge.  Marge leaves Artie and returns to home find out that Homer has left town with Lenny.  On the road, Homer and Lenny get a job at oil rig in West Springfield, which is "three times larger than Texas".  Bart, Lisa and Marge figure out where Homer's at, but Marge needs help from Artie to find out exactly where he is.  With his oil rig on fire, Homer declines rescue, until Artie gives up on Marge.  Artie creates a solution for Homer's snoring problem, which at a subliminal level may help Artie with his Marge problem.

                            <p>After giving up the Olympic torch that Homer has stolen, the family stops in at a carnival being held at a private school.  Bart comes to the aid of a young girl being bullied.  The girl is the daughter of Rainier Wolfcastle and she invites Bart to come to her house sometime.  Bart goes to Greta's home and has a great time.  The Wolfcastles come to the Simpson home and Greta expresses her interest in Bart, although he is a little slow on the uptake.  On Bart's next visit he brings Milhouse.  Greta invites Bart to her school dance, only Bart finds out that Skinner is going to be performing stand-up comedy and he can't resist.  Skinner's act bombs, much to Bart's delight.  Working with the theory that "women are easy, state capitals are hard", Bart breaks up with Greta.  For revenge Greta starts hanging out with Milhouse.  She then joins her dad for a film shoot in Toronto.  Bart asks the family if they can go to Toronto.  At Paramountie Studios Bart finds Greta only to find out that she interested in either Bart or Milhouse, so they both join the Canadian Olympic Basketball team.  Back in Springfield, Skinner's act still sucks.

                            <p>Homer is anxiously awaiting the start of the new XFL season when the Springfield Retirement Castle calls to report the death of Abraham Simpson, but the report is a mistake.  A new woman moves in down the hall and Grandpa decides that he wants to be able to drive a car again, one so that he can feel alive again and two so that he can impress the new woman, Zelda.  With his new license in hand, Grandpa borrows Homer's car for a series of dates with Zelda.  In a role reversal, Homer has to lay down the law when Abe stays out with the car all night.  Abe runs into trouble at the Kwik-E-Mart with a rival gang of retirees that results in him competing in a death race.  Abe wins the race, but Homer's car is ruined.  Homer revokes Abe driving privileges.  Zelda has a reservation in Branson and she goes with Abe's rival.  Abe steals Marge's car and goes with Bart to Branson to get her back.  When they get there Abe actually just gets back at her and calls her the "hootchie" everybody said she was.

                            <p>Homer gets a letter from the library telling him about an overdue book.  He checked it out when Bart was born to have something to read his child.  Lisa suggests that he read them some stories from it now.  Homer starts by telling the tale of the…

a). "Odyssey"

Homer is Odysseus, who delivers a Trojan horse to the King.  After his troops are victorious, Odysseus ticks off the gods by refusing to make a sacrifice.  They take their revenge upon him when they blow him and his crew off course, where they almost meet the Sirens and finally Circe, who turns his men into pigs.  After Odysseus eats his men, he has to cross the river Styx to return home.  When he arrives he takes out the trash.

b). "Joan of Arc"

Lisa is Joan in this retelling of the story of Joan of Arc.  Joan sets out to help lead the French army to victory against the English, which she does, until she is captured.  Joan is found guilty and is about to be burned at the stake, when Marge, not much for tragic endings, changes the ending so that Joan lives.

c). "Hamlet"

Bart is Hamlet and Homer asks him to avenge his death.  Moe (as Uncle Claudius) had Homer killed so that he could marry the queen (Marge) and take over the kingdom.  Hamlet discovers the king's treachery and goes to avenge his father's death.  When he kills the wrong man, he must duel with Laertes (Ralph).  When Laertes dispatches himself, Hamlet kills Uncle Claudius, then himself.  Rather than clean up the mess, the queen also dispatches herself.  Everyone is dead.

Bart can't believe how boring the last story was, but Homer reminds him that is also became a great movie called "Ghostbusters."  The family dances as the theme to that classic film plays in the background.

                            <p>The family receives a $400 phone bill for a phone call to Brazil.  Marge and Homer go down to the phone office to get this error corrected, they didn't make the call.  Their visit results in their phone service getting cut off.  Homer tries to steal phone service, but gets electrocuted for his trouble.  Lisa confesses to making the call and tells them of the donations she'd made for an orphan boy named Renaldo in Brazil, with whom she'd lost contact with.  The family decides to make a trip to Brazil to find him.  The family flies down to Rio, as Maggie takes care of herself, under the watchful eyes of Patty and Selma.  They split up with Lisa and Marge looking on one side of town and Homer and Bart on the other.  Homer gets kidnapped when he gets into an unlicensed taxi.  The kidnappers take Homer up the Amazon.  Marge reports the kidnapping to an uncaring police department and Homer tries to raise the $50,000 on his own.  Lisa finds Renaldo working for the kids show that Bart has watched with great sexual interest since arriving in Rio.  Renaldo is now wealthy, thanks to the new dancing shoes Lisa's donation purchased for him, so he gives Lisa the $50,000 that will let them get Homer from the kidnappers.  The transfer is made and Homer is returned, but as we leave our friends in Rio, Bart is celebrating Carnival in the belly of a snake.

                            <p>Marge plants her own garden and when the crows arrive she puts up a scarecrow.  Homer himself is scared by the scarecrow, so he sneaks upon it and destroys it.  As a result, the crows look up to him as their leader.  The crows hang out with him wherever he goes.  The crows eventually overstay their welcome and Homer tries to shoo them away, the respond by attacking him.  At the hospital, when Homer asks Dr. Hibbert what can be done for the pain in his eyes Dr. Hibbert prescribes medical marijuana.  Homer starts getting legally high.  At one point, in his high state of mind, Homer allows Flanders to read the entire bible to him.  Flanders is also gets Homer's signature on a petition to get a ban on medical marijuana added to the next election's ballot.  Being high at work also does a wonder for his career at the power plant, because when Homer laughs at all of Mr. Burn's jokes he is given a promotion to executive vice-president.  Homer finds out about the ban being added to the ballot and a rally is organized in protest.  The band Phish appears at the rally, but the attendees "have spaced on the date", they held their rally one day after the election; so medical marijuana has been banned.  The medical marijuana is burned.  Homer's medical condition was long since cured, Homer promises to never to smoke pot again.  Mr. Burns calls Homer into help with his speech.  Mr. Burns need to raise $60 million to appease his investors.  Homer tries, but Smithers needs the use of Homer's last joint to think any of Mr. Burn's speech is funny.  When Mr. Burns appears to dead from drowning in his bathtub, Smithers and Homer turn him into a marionette so that he can still appear before the investors.  A dance performance by the strung up Mr. Burns gets his heart started again and he has recovered well enough to learn that the investors were distracted enough to not worry about the $60 million.

                            <p>Our story begins a la "Forrest Gump", with Homer sitting on a park bench waiting for the rest of the family to arrive.  While Chief Wiggum initially tells him isn't interested in hearing Homer's life story initially, he becomes intrigued as Homer goes right into it, in the form of flashbacks (clips).  Homer is picked up and brought blindfolded to the Springfield Friar's Club where emcee Krusty the Klown and other friends and family roast Homer with their memories (more clips from past episodes).  Bart and Lisa start followed by Mr. Burns, Grampa Simpson & Agnes Skinner, Reverend Lovejoy & Ned Flanders (a la "The Smothers Brothers").  The proceedings are interrupted by Kodos and Kang, whom rest the entire fate of humanity upon one human being, Homer Simpson; they cite him as "the fat selfish epitome of modern man".  They probe him revealing more clips, which helps prove to them that humans are unfit to continue existing.  Lisa talks them into probing the innocent mind of a child.  The probing of Maggie's mind reveals to Kodos and Kang the most important thing of all for them; Earth is where there favorite celebrities live.  Kodos and Kang attend the "People Choice Awards" and the episode ends with a wacky little ditty celebrating more clips, but telling the viewers "not to fear, they have stories for years."

                            <p>Springfield Elementary finally gets a career day speaker that keeps the children's interest.  The creator of cartoon inspires the children to come up with their own cartoon characters.  Bart makes an initial comic strip of "Danger Dude," which he shows to the Comic Book Guy and Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee who happens to stop by the comic book shop, but never leaves.  Their feedback leads Bart to search for other inspiration, which he finds in his own father.  He makes Homer the main character in a comic that he calls "Angry Dad".  It becomes very popular and an Internet company wants to make "Angry Dad" an Internet cartoon.  They offer Bart stock in return for use of his strip.  "Angry Dad" becomes even more popular, but when Homer sees it at work, he goes home very angry.  The citizens of Springfield, who see him in his car angry, try to make him angrier to see what he'll do.  The family realizes that Homer has anger management issues.  Homer resolves to take it easy, leaving Bart without any material.  Bart sets an elaborate trap to anger the now sedate Homer.  Bart finds out that the Internet company has gone bankrupt and doesn't need his new material, just as Homer takes the bait for the trap.  Homer gets green with anger, a la The Incredible Hulk and it turns out Bart has saved Homer's life; since the pent up rage would have killed him.

After the children have left, Apu believes that the Squishee delivery lady has made a pass at him, by calling him handsome.  The Simpson family is participating in the Civil War reenactment.  Homer gets Barney (playing General Grant) to drink a mug of beer.  The reenactment is "ripe with inaccuracies."  Homer goes back to the Kwik-E-Mart and discovers Apu making out with the Squishee lady, he back out of the store all the way home and into bed.  He has nightmares about the encounter and tells Marge guesses at what he's seen.  They both have difficulty facing Apu and Manjula together.  They confront Apu and soon Manjula finds out.  She throws him out.  Marge and Homer concoct a plan to bring Manjula and Apu back together.  Apu asks for forgiveness, but gets divorce papers instead.

After seeing a vision of President Kennedy, Lisa is inspired to give gymnastics her best shot.  While Bart is spending time with Grandpa he gets bitten by a Chinese mosquito.  Lisa finds out that her fellow gymnastics students are actually college age, and rather than be embarrassed by her real age, she lets them think she is college age as well.  Bart is diagnosed with "Panda virus" which makes him contagious, so Dr. Hibbert puts him in a plastic bubble for a week.  Meanwhile Lisa has started hanging out with college age students at a coffee house listening to Robert Pinsky read his poetry.  Bart starts using his plastic bubble to rescue nerds from the bullies.  Some of those nerds follow Lisa when they think she is up to something.  They find her at college analyzing "Itchy and Scratchy" cartoons and Milhouse exposes her.  Embarrassed she leaves and back at home, she gets in trouble for going to college (16 credit hours worth) and her fellow grade school students won't relate with her anymore.  She gets advice from Bart on how to win them back, which she does by making a splash on the cake created for Seymour Skinner Day.

                            <p>Homer's ordered Marge an anniversary gift, a pond for the backyard.  The new pond attracts a screaming caterpillar.  The "screamapillar" as the family finds out is an endangered species and by law they are responsible for its well being.  When Homer believes he has killed the insect he tries to hide that fact.  The "screamapillar" is okay, but Homer is found guilty of "attempted insecticide" and "aggravated buggery" and is sentenced to 200 hours of community service.  Homer begins delivering "Meals on Wheels" and runs scared into the closet when one of his elderly clients appears to be threatening him with an axe.  It turns out she is just a kindly old woman, who asks Homer to join him for some company.  He starts lending her a hand, and she seems to be taking advantage of him.  Marge goes to see her and then finds herself helping the old woman as much as Homer has been.  When the old woman turns up dead; Homer and Marge are considered top suspects, when they are named beneficiaries of the woman's will.  They suspect the "man with braces," who they saw leaving the scene.  Everyone suspects them.  When the woman's diamond necklace is found in their home, they are arrested.  The children are sent to a yokel foster home and Marge and Homer are found guilty and sentenced to the electric chair.  When Homer realizes that Marge is going to miss the children, he confesses to the crime, which allows for her release.  On the electric chair Homer is about to be electrocuted when it is revealed he is a participant on a new reality game show "Frame Up".  The man with the braces is the host, and Homer's murder victim is actually still alive.  The old woman is actually Carmen Electra in disguise.  Homer is freed, but disgusted that people's lives are toyed with for TV ratings; this he says while looking Carmen Electra directly in the breasts.

The nuclear plant is at capacity and when one of its crack employees, Homer Simpson, plugs in just one appliance too many, the city has a blackout.  Looting begins and the police are ineffective.  In an attempt to try doing something right for a change, Homer starts his own security company to help keep order.  Chief Wiggum finds himself without a job, when Mayor Quimby decides that "Spring Shield" security should become the city's new police force.  Homer shuts down one of Fat Tony's operations and with that crime is non-existent.  Fat Tony makes a public announcement that he is going to gun down Homer if he isn't out of town by tomorrow at noon.  Homer appeals for help, only no one of importance offers to help.  The following day, Fat Tony and New Jersey associates a la The Sopranos go to the Simpson home.  Shots ring out, effectively wounding Fat Tony and friends.  Homer decides to give his badge to the next person he sees, which happens to be Clancy Wiggum.  He comments that's the way he got the job in the past, he also disavows any knowledge of the shots; but we know who the shooter is, it's Maggie Simpson.

Ned reveals his secret as hard work, honest living and flossing his teeth, tail and toes.  Also a little prayer now and again doesn't hurt either.  Homer focuses on the notion of the little prayer and when he needs to find the remote for his TV, his own little prayer works.  He begins to pray for a number of things.  His prayer for a new home pays off when he trips into a hole outside of the church.  His lawsuit against the church wins him the deed to the church, since the church can't afford to pay him $1 million.  Homer turns the church into a party palace.  Without a place to preach, Reverend Lovejoy and his wife leave Springfield, when preaching at the bowling alley and staying at Ned's house just doesn't work for the Reverend.  The partying at the church gets out of hand; Marge asks Homer if he is afraid of incurring God's wrath.  Homer isn't so sure, but then the rainfall begins and Homer is struck by lightning.

                            <p>01.) Treehouse of Horror XIII</p>
                            <p>The family (along with Ned Flanders) holds a séance which brings the ghost of Maude Flanders back from the grave.  With her presence in the room, she opens a book which brings us these three tales.

a). "Send in the Clones"

Homer finds that his new hammock is capable of making clones, and he begins making and using the clones to do all of his chores.  When one of the clones permanently takes care of Flanders, Homer decides to get rid of the clones and the hammock.  So he takes them both out to cornfield where he leaves them.  Only the clones begin using the hammock and start to proliferate themselves at an enormous rate, soon the town of Springfield is under invasion by an army of Homer clones.  It's up to Lisa to give the army a suggestion that help them eliminate the clone problem.

b). "The Right to Keep and Scare Harms"

Lisa finds the grave of William Bonney who was killed by gun violence.  In his memory, she starts a gun control crusade, which makes Springfield totally gun-free; even the police no longer have guns.  Now defenseless, the corpse of William "Billy the Kid" Bonney and his cohorts rise from the dead and start raising havoc in town.  Professor Frink develops a time machine, which Homer uses to go back to the recent past to stop the ban on guns.

c). "The Island of Dr. Hibbert"

The family takes a trip to "The Island of Lost Souls," where they find Dr. Hibbert is running the island's resort.  Marge thinks that something creepy is going on there, but when she goes off to investigate she is captured by Dr. Hibbert who turns her into a cat woman.  Homer goes in search of a cure for Marge's condition and encounters Ned Flanders (who needs to be milked).  Flanders takes Homer to meet the others who've been converted into beasts.  While initially horrified at what they've all become, after thinking about it, he decides it might just be the life for him.

                            <p>When Homer can't pay for his beer, he finds alternate means for altering his consciousness.  When he finally is given a beer, it puts him over the edge and into a cab home.  His cab ride home is videotaped (a la HBO's Taxi Cab Confessions) and his family sees him complaining about them, the family got in the way of his dream to be a rock star.  To help him get over these feelings, they send him to The Rolling Stones' Rock N' Roll Fantasy Camp.  Homer, Barney, Apu and others learn how to be a rock star from the likes of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Elvis Costello, Lenny Kravitz, Brian Setzer, and Tom Petty.  When his dream week is over, Homer is totally despondent; his rock star dream has been shattered.  Mick offers him the opportunity to help them out with their upcoming benefit gig.  Everyone (including Homer) thinks he is going to play on stage with the stars; the rock stars of course just want him to be their roadie.  When he starts testing the microphones, he starts to steal the show, the rock stars fight back and a riot breaks out.

                            <p>03.) Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade</p>
                            <p>Tired of "suckling on the six network teat," with their endless array of "reality shows," the Simpson family gets a satellite dish.  Homer and Bart spend hours surfing all of the available channels.  While Lisa studies for the school's upcoming achievement test; Bart doesn't, as he engrossed in Japanese Friends amongst and other lame satellite TV programming.  Bart zones out during the test and daydreams about everything he's been watching lately.  At a school assembly the next day, Principal Skinner announces that because of Lisa's high test score, she is being promoted to the 3rd grade.  When Bart makes a comment about Lisa, Principal Skinner responds by also announcing that because of his low test score, Bart is being demoted to the 3rd grade.  They'll be in class together, much to each other's horror.  Lisa has a hard time adapting to the 3rd grade, as Bart is coming off as a much better student than he actually is.  They go on a field trip to Capital City and Bart and Lisa are put together via the buddy system.  Their teacher, Mrs. McConnell, decides that the students are going to help the state design a new flag.  When Bart overhears Lisa breaking bad on him, he redesigns their entry.  Lisa's anger with Bart causes them to fight and miss their bus back home.  Bart and Lisa attempt to get home on their own, meanwhile Principal Skinner reports their disappearance to Homer and Marge, who subsequently journey to Capital City to try to find them.  Bart and Lisa encounter a family of mountain folk, who take them back to the big city to reunite them with their family.  Realizing that the "status quo" is best all-around, Principal Skinner returns Bart and Lisa's academic careers to normal.

                            <p>Marge sees Homer flirting with two women and later tries to decide whether he is still interested in her or not.  Homer's response is to fall asleep.  Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse are watching Krusty playing the villain "Clownface" on an episode of the old Batman television series and are inspired to recreate the carousel sequence.  Marge asks Manjula what she should do about Homer and Manjula responds by taking her to a plastic surgery clinic.  Marge goes in for a liposuction procedure and winds up with breast implants.  The doctor gives her 48 hours to try living with them before he will take them out.  At school, Bart gets Milhouse spun at a high speed on the carousel; so fast that he spins out of control, resulting in his knocking over the flagpole and throwing up on the flag.  When confronted for his part in this act of unpatriotic behavior, Bart cites Krusty as the influence; making Krusty a very unpopular figure.  Homer discovers her implants and at dinner the next night, Homer and the men of Springfield sing the praises of her new endowment.  Marge gets offered a trade show modeling job.  Marge gets into her new image until the extra weight up front of starts giving her back problems.  At the trade show, Bart's old friend Stampy and Marge's gifts are used to help Krusty get his reputation back.  Afterwards surgery is preformed to reverse Marge's condition and the Baha Men sings the praises of her Jugs with a little help from Homer.

                            <p>When Homer is injured at work, his compensation is use of a luxury sky box.  The family enjoys the luxuries, but Lisa is bored and joins the masses rink side.  She gives one of the players some score tying advice and is rewarded with Kozlov's hockey "tree".  The stick is mounted in Lisa's room where later that night termites break out of the stick and do much damage to the family home.  Until the Russian no-wood-nick termites can be thoroughly exterminated, 6 months from now, the Simpson family is homeless.  The family tries a number of options but settle upon trying out for a home where they are required to live like its 1895.  They pass the audition and start living the lifestyle.  When the "1895 Challenge" sinks in the ratings, the producers try to stir things up by adding Squiggy from Laverne and Shirley.  When even that doesn't work, they relocate the house to a river and watch it float downstream.  Eventually the house comes to shore and falls apart.  Now the family finds themselves without food and shelter as the TV crew eats away.  The encounter and tribe of refugees from another reality program and together they fight to return to civilization, where they can find quality scripted television.  When even that fails them, they start to entertain themselves.

                            <p>Lisa dreams of being honored as one of three great Americans, only to be waken by Marge's vacuum.  Marge and the rest of the family have begun spring cleaning.  Bart finds a box of old videotapes.  He and Lisa start watching the tapes that are boring them, until Lisa finds a tape labeled "BART SAD."  They put in the tape, which features an episode of Perfect Strangers and a commercial for a product that fights bad breath for babies.  The baby featured in the ad is none other than Bart, leading Lisa to realize the tape should have been titled "Bart's Ad."  The baby in the ad is referred to as "Baby Stinkbreath," which opens Bart up to name calling by his siblings.  Bart confronts his parents about the ad and Homer tells him he was going to tell him on his "death bed."  They tell him he enjoyed making the commercials and he made a lot of money that Homer invested in a college trust fund.  Homer confesses that he used the money to buy back incriminating photos.  Bart demands the return of his money; Milhouse suggests that he get a lawyer.  He finds a lawyer and tells him he wants a divorce from his parents.  In court, Judge Harm renders her verdict, Bart is emancipated and half Homer's salary is to go to Bart.  Bart moves out and into a loft apartment.  His first night alone he is scared by a rat and runs to the elevator that takes him up instead of down.  The doors open to a loft apartment that contains skateboard ramps, "skate boarding legend Tony Hawk" and the band "blink - 182" playing live in the corner.  The family comes to visit Bart at his new home, where Bart appears to be living the good life.  Homer makes a plea for his return, but Bart tells them he is taking off for six months to go on the "Skewed Extreme Sports Tour."  At the Springfield stop of the tour, Homer talks Tony Hawk into losing to him in a skateboarding contest so that Homer might win back Bart's affection.  When wins the contest, Bart informs him it was about being cool, it was really about Homer not caring about how he felt.  With a bit of advice from Tony Hawk, Homer makes an apology and gets a lucrative commercial endorsement for "Viagra-Gain" which allows him to repay Bart, who returns home.

                            <p>The kids are getting ready to go back to school.  On the first day, Principal Skinner holds an all school Spelling Bee, which Lisa easily wins, allowing her to go to the state spelling finals.  If she wins there, she can then go Spellympics.  Meanwhile, Homer has been trying Krustyburger's new "Ribwich" and enjoying it immensely.  At the state Spelling Bee Lisa wins, but is disappointed with Homer who tells her that "very serious Daddy business" is going to keep him away from her celebration.  Homer's daddy business consists of getting more Ribwiches.  He is disappointed when the Ribwich is no longer available.  Another Ribwich fan (and member of Ribwich Nation) informs Homer that the sandwich is going to be tested in other markets and he shows him the tour schedule.  For a moment, Homer considers joining them on their bus tour.  For her spelling efforts, Lisa is rewarded with a double-wide locker and she prepares for the Spellympics.  At the Spellympics, Lisa makes it to the finals.  Homer regrets that he won't be able to attend the finals, as he will be in San Francisco for the last day of the Ribwich.  George Plimpton talks to Lisa about getting her to throw the spelling bee so that a more popular competitor can help keep spelling a viable sport.  For throwing the bee, Lisa is offered a full scholarship to one of the seven sister's college of her choice.  Lisa wrestles with her conscience.  In San Francisco, Krusty stops by and tells the crowd they will no longer be making the Ribwich and he tosses them the last one.  Homer catches it, and offers are made to him for the last one.  He realizes that he's forsaken his daughter's big day for a sandwich and he trades it for a car, which he drives off to Lisa's big event.  At the Spellympics, Homer arrives just in time for Lisa to do her final word.  With her dad present, she blows the lid off of the rigged contest, but then misspells her word in the process.  She loses the contest, but back home in Springfield she is celebrated as "the biggest winner this town has ever had."  They even have her likeness carved into the side of a mountain.

                            <p>On St. Valentine's Day Marge is too tired in participating in the lovemaking that Homer was so looking forward to.  Dejected, Homer leaves the house and stumbles across a billboard for some extension courses.  When he is thrown out of the "Strip for Your Wife" class led by Dr. Hibbert, he stumbles into "Successmanship 101" class.  He gets the book for the class and with it he decides to change the direction of his life.  Homer goes into work with a new attitude, but when he presents his ideas for improvements to Mr. Burns, they are all rejected unread.  Later when Homer overhears that Mr. Burns actually has a canary named as the plant's legal owner.  With this information and some encouragement from his family Homer decides upon a plan.  With Bart's help, Homer releases the bird, which leaves the plant with no owner.  In rare sign of intelligence, Homer outwits Mr. Burns and is able to take over the vacancy left by the canary.  His first act in his new job is to fire Mr. Burns.  Now Homer is in charge of the power plant and besides learning about the "door shutting thing" he soon learns how difficult it is to be at the top.  He misses out on quality time with his family.  Mr. Burns returns for a visit and shows Homer the people he missed out on being with throughout his life, Mr. Burns then tries to kill Homer by drugging him and sealing him in a tomb.  He isn't fast enough as Homer recovers and easily escapes.  As a wrap up to his latest escapade Homer (and everyone) celebrate "HOMER'S 305th EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL BBQ."

                            <p>Principal Skinner introduces the students of Springfield Elementary to Declan Desmond, a documentary filmmaker.  Desmond is there to do a documentary on the school.  The children see an example of his work in the form of his documentary on Krusty Burger called "Do You Want Lies With That?"  He starts filming his documentary by focusing on school bullies.  Bart is being featured on camera for his role as a school bully, when he is humiliated by Nelson, the bigger bully.  Principal Skinner tries to divert Desmond's attention by focusing on Lisa.  Desmond easily spots the ruse and gives Lisa some advice that she should pick a path and follow it.  Bart searches for a way to become cool again.  When Nelson shows off a hood ornament he's stolen, Bart decides he needs to do the same, only bigger.  Lisa looks for career direction and finds inspiration at an astronomy exhibit.  Lisa gets Homer to buy her a telescope, only she soon discovers that light pollution from the town obscures her view.  Bart tries to regain his position, as Desmond watches.  He then finds Lisa is circulating a petition to reduce Springfield's light pollution.  It works and lights are put down, yes the stars have come out, but so have the criminals.  Nelson and company steal more hood ornaments.  Bart targets the ornate (Emmy award looking) hood ornament of Fat Tony's car.  Mayor Quimby caves into pressure from the townspeople and restores the lights of Springfield, to the point where it's daytime at night.  Bart and Milhouse were almost able to steal Fat Tony's hood ornament, when the lights go on.  24 hours of "daylight" begin to take their toll on the townspeople.  Bart is still scoping out Fat Tony's hood ornament, he only needs the cover of darkness to pull of his crime.  Since he and Lisa want the same thing, they team up to get Homer to go into power plant and overload the city's lights.  Springfield is back in the dark when the townspeople come to protest the lack of lights.  Fortunately for Bart and Lisa a meteor shower begins and that distracts everyone.  In the end, Declan Desmond's documentary "American Boneheads: A Day in the Life of Springfield Elementary" is shown.

When they carol outside of a lawyer's house, he informs them they can't sing the song they're singing without paying a royalty.  This inspires Homer to decide to write his own Christmas carol, but when Flanders tries to help and begins annoying him, Homer is instead inspired to write an anti-Flanders song.  Homer plays his new song at Moe's where a passing David Byrne overhears it and offers to produce and record it.  The song "Everybody Hates Ned Flanders" becomes a national hit and is even covered by William Shatner.  To get away from the over-exposure of the hit song, the family decides to take a vacation to a dude ranch.  At the Lazy I ranch, Comic Book Guy looks for an Internet connection and Lisa is annoyed to find out that the ranch was built on cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.  Lisa wants to go home, until sometime later when she meets Luke Stetson, a junior wrangler who shares her views.  Homer and Bart meet some indigenous people who tell them that they've lost their land to a natural beaver dam.  Homer gets them to agree to build a fair casino, if he helps them get back their land.  Lisa overhears that Luke already has a girlfriend named Clara and her heart is broken.  Lisa encounters Clara and gives her false directions to the dance.  Homer and Bart manage to outsmart the beavers and indigenous people are able to reclaim their land.  At the dance, Lisa finds out that Clara, her competition is actually Luke's sister.  Lisa gets Bart to help her find Clara, who they rescue with the help of some beavers.  The family is set to return to Springfield, when they hear a new David Byrne produced song on the radio "The Moe Szyslak Connection" and decide they can afford another week at the ranch.

                            <p>19.) Old Yeller Belly</p>
                            <p>Bart's tree house is destroyed and the Amish are called in to rebuild it.  Because the Amish are master electricians, Bart's new tree house catches fire at its grand opening.  Everyone makes it to safety, with the exception of Homer, who is trapped.  He looks to the family dog for help, but Santa's Little Helper (SLH) is a coward and only saves himself.  It's up to Snowball II to save Homer's life.  Snowball II is made a hero in Homer's eyes and SLH is thrown out of the house.  The dog park is turned into a cat park and renamed for Snowball II.  SLH doesn't look very good in the eyes of his fellow dogs either.  Kent Brockman asks Homer about his cat and any other pets he may have and Homer makes the bold statement that "I have no dog."  Bart and Lisa look to help SLH regain his status as family dog.  Their efforts fail.  A passing photographer spots SLH drinking beer from a can that he is balancing on his nose.  The photo appears in the paper and the owner of Duff Brewery decides its time to replace Duffman with a dog.  The family signs a contract for the brewery's new spokesdog "Suds McDuff."  The new campaign is a hit.  The family stands to make lots of money, until SLH's original owner from the dog track comes to lay claim to his dog.  He uses a tape of Homer's own words against him as proof of his continued ownership of the dog.  SLH is being exploited by his original owner.  The family comes up with a plan to get their dog back.  They find the actor who played Duffman (Barry Duffman) and plan to have him rescue a drowning Homer, when it becomes obvious to the crown that "Suds McDuff" is a cowardly dog.  The plan doesn't work, when Duffman turns out to be as cowardly as his replacement.  The shark that tried to attack Homer becomes "wasted" on the Duff beer that came out of the keg that Homer was floating on.  As a result, the shark becomes the company's new mascot.  With his gravy train at an end, SLH's original owner returns the dog back to the family.

                            <p>20.) Brake My Wife, Please</p>
                            <p>At the Springfield Aquarium, Marge accompanies the kids on a school field trip.  Lisa spots penguins flying and after Bart has shown off his "flawless pearls," which results in him being taken the hospital, where a lack of insurance card keeps him prisoner.  Homer has the insurance card, but is nowhere to be found.  As a solution, Homer gets a mobile phone and a few extra unnecessary accessories, which only leads to him not paying attention to where he is driving.  That is until it is much too late and he drives off of a pier.  Judge Harm takes his license away and Homer is no longer able to drive.  Marge picks up the slack and starts becoming "Stresserella."  Homer walks to Moe's, but much to Moe's dismay he decide to keep on walking and starts getting healthy.  Homer walks to work and is the only employee to arrive, everyone else is caught in a traffic jam.  Marge is frazzled from all her driving, meanwhile Homer sings and walks about the virtues of walking when he is stuck by a car; the driver of the car was Marge.  Marge, who cares so much for Homer, tries to help in his recovery, but Homer perceives that she might be trying to kill him.  It leads to fight, which in turn leads them to see a marriage counselor.  After Marge leaves, the counselor suggests that Homer perform one unselfish act of love to win Marge back, in other words take her to dinner.  Homer decides to one up that suggestion and invites everyone in Springfield (except the Flanders family) to a backyard barbeque in Marge's honor.  Homer joins Jackson Browne in a duet to sing his praises of Marge.

                            <p>21.) The Bart of War</p>
                            <p>When Marge sees Bart and Milhouse incited to violence after watching an episode of South Park, she tries to turn them onto some good television on the PAX television network.  They run out of the room and find themselves outside and bored.  After tying a thread to a housefly, that lands itself inside of the Flanders home, Bart and Milhouse find themselves inside the home, unsupervised.  They cause some damage and find Ned's collection of Beatles memorabilia.  They drink from cans of a 40-year-old novelty beverage and start to get sick.  Ned and the boys return to their home to find the house "slightly askew," and they flee to their panic room and call the police.  The police arrive and capture the boys and Bart pleads that his parents not be called.  The parents are called and as part of Bart's punishment he is sentenced to spending all his time under the supervision of a parent.  He is also no longer allowed to play with Milhouse, who Marge believes incites Bart into his bad behavior.  Bart joins the "Pre-Teen Braves" and Homer becomes the tribe leader.  When Homer fails in his leadership skills, Marge takes over.  Marge takes the boys on a nature walk and they meet a Native American who shows them a field that is in need of restoration.  The "Pre-Teen Braves" return to the field to begin their clean-up effort, only to discover that the "Calvary Kids" that Milhouse and his father are a members of have already done the job.  The two groups go to war and try to outdo each other in doing good.  When the opportunity to become batboys at an Isotopes game is on the line, the two sides redouble their efforts for their candy sales.  The "Pre-Teen Braves" lace the "Calvary Kids" candy bars with laxatives and believe they are going to win.  Only the senior citizens, in a need of relief from constipation, buy the "Calvary Kids" a win.  At the Isotopes game, the "Calvary Kids" are delayed from arriving and the "Pre-Teen Braves" take their place singing their version of the national anthem.  The crowd becomes angered by the version of the anthem that is being sung and when the real "Calvary Kids" arrive, a fight breaks out between everyone in the crowd.  When the image of Marge crying is shown on the Jumbotron, the fighting ends and the sweet soothing hymn of the national anthem of Canada is sung by all present.  In the end, Bart and Milhouse sum it up by saying that they've learned that: "War is not the answer--except to all of America's problems."

                            <p>22.) Moe Baby Blues</p>
                            <p>The family goes to the Springfield Botanical Gardens, where they and the other residents are there to see the blossoming of the Sumatran Century Flower.  When his bar is empty, Moe finds out that is where all his customers have gone and he goes to join them.  With a capacity crowd plus one on hand, Chief Wiggum has to send someone away and he selects Moe.  As a result, Moe is one of the only ones to not be driven out of town by the obnoxious and somewhat lethal (to other plant life) smell of the Sumatran Century Flower when it finally does bloom.  The mass exodus from Springfield results in a huge traffic jam on the Springfield Bridge.  When traffic begins to move, Homer hits the accelerator, only to have to immediately slam on the brakes, because traffic didn't move that far.  The quick stop to family car and the faulty seat restraint that was holding Maggie in the backseat causes her to be launch through the sunroof and over the side of the bridge.  She lands in the arms of Moe, who was perched on the side of the bridge ready to commit suicide.  Moe becomes a hero.  Moe stops by to see Maggie and winds up watching her when Marge needs to care of Grampa, who's out on the street acting crazier than normal.  Moe becomes Maggie's fulltime babysitter.  Moe entertains Maggie by telling her a story; of course it's "The Godfather" saga.  Late in the evening after Maggie's birthday party, where Homer began to learn that Maggie prefers Moe over him, Marge and Homer hear Maggie crying.  They go to her room only to find Moe already there calming her down.  They forbid him to ever see her again.  The next day, Moe is lonely and missing Maggie.  That night, outside her window, Maggie overhears Fat Tony and his boys plan to take out the Castellaneta family.  She crawls out her window and begins pursuing them.  Marge discovers Maggie is gone and they immediately suspect Moe.  When Moe doesn't have her and he finds out she is missing, he offers to help.  Clues outside Maggie's window reveal that the mob was gathered outside of her window and Moe suggests that they might find her in little Italy.  At a restaurant in Little Italy Maggie finds she is in the middle of an "Italian-American Mexican standoff."  Moe volunteers to go in and rescue her.  He draws the mobster's attention to Maggie which causes them to all go soft.  Moe returns Maggie to Homer and Marge and prepares to leave; only Maggie doesn't want him to go.  Homer and Marge agree that Moe can have the occasional play date with Maggie, provided he brings along his ham to accompany Homer.

                            <p>Bart lectures the other students on water balloons and after hitting Lisa with one he gets into a fight with her all the way home.  Marge tells the pair that they are going to Dayton, Ohio to celebrate Uncle Tyrone's birthday.  Bart and Lisa aren't thrilled with the idea and get to stay home.  As a family activity they rent a video, "Love Story" and Bart and Lisa are bored by it such that they ruin any moment the film might have created for Homer and Marge.  Homer and Marge look forward to their trip without the kids and on a whim they decide to forgo seeing Uncle Tyrone and get on a plane to Miami.  Lisa and Bart are aware that the hotel in Dayton where Marge and Homer were supposed to be staying was wiped out by a tornado.  Bart discovers there parents are in Miami.  They get Grandpa to take them there.  While Bart and Lisa find their parents, Grandpa goes looking for companionship.  Marge and Homer see the kids waiting for them so they take off again, only Bart and Lisa are on their trail.  Homer and Marge are in Atlantic City when they spot the kids so they go on the run from them in an instrumental musical montage.  Meanwhile Abe has found companionship in Miami with a man named Raoul who appreciates his rambling stories.  Homer and Marge finally find themselves in Niagara Falls, but the kids are their as well.  Feeling a little guilty Bart and Lisa decide to give their parents their space and go to the amusement park only to find their parents are already there.  Homer and Marge run from the pair only to find refuge in a giant inflatable castle, which their lovemaking antics cause to fall into the Niagara River.  The couple floats toward the falls and certain death only to be saved by their large floatation device.  Later back in Springfield, Ned and Rod Flanders receive their credit card bills.

                            <p>19.) Simple Simpson</p>
                            <p>Homer is intrigued by a commercial that talks about a contest that will allow the winner, the finder of a golden ticket, a trip to "Farmer Billy's Bacon Factory."  Homer buys a lot of pork products but is only able to find a silver ticket, which allows him to judge the pig competition at the county fair.  When Homer sees an injustice being done to Lisa's entry in the place setting competition, he decides to take action.  Remembering Chief Wiggum's warning about felony assault, he disguises himself as "Pie Man" and delivers a pie in the face as revenge.  He disappears as quickly as he came, making Springfield wonder if they will ever see him again.  When Bart gets ripped off by Comic Book Guy, "Pie Man" delivers some "key lime justice."  The police decide that "Pie Man" needs to be stopped and they shoot him when he makes his next appearance.  He takes time out from his fleeing to save Marge and then kisses her, even though she tells him she's a married woman.  Later at home, the wounded Homer makes a promise to Lisa (who's figured out his disguise) that he will stop his pie avenging.  When Mr. Burns goes too far, "Pie Man" makes another appearance, but his escape from the plant is thwarted by his own laziness.  Mr. Burns turns him into his personal hit man.  Homer finds himself in a dilemma when Mr. Burns wants him to deliver a pie in the face of Lisa's Buddhist hero the Dalai Lama.  When he comes clean in front of a crowd, no one believes that he was capable of being the "Pie Man," only his family believes in him.

                            <p>Homer and Bart get into a fight over using a beer bottle to kiss girls which land them in Simpson family court, where Lisa presides as judge.  While giving testimony Marge tells the kids that Homer's first kiss was with her in high school.  He confesses that it wasn't his first kiss.  Back when he was ten he went to camp See-A-Tree (for underprivileged boys).  Here he meets Lenny, Carl and Moe.  The boys go to the girl's camp where they work in the kitchen.  After Homer returns the retainer to the girl who lost it he gets the opportunity to meet her later that night.  He tells the kids she was the prettiest girl he'd ever seen, until he later met their mother.  Marge reveals that the girl was her.  Marge tells the story from her perspective.  At the girls camp, Land-A-Man, we find Marge, Patty, Selma, Helen (Lovejoy), Cookie Kwan.  When she met Homer that it was she who first kisses him and then they have the perfect kiss.  They agree to meet again the following night, but Homer doesn't show.  Marge says it was years before she could trust another boy.  Homer explains why he didn't return for a second date.  After he left her he fell off a cliff into the lake and drifted to the shores of "Camp Flab-Away," which featured Quimby, Wiggum and Comic Book Guy as some of the overweight campers.  Homer manages to escape and gets to Marge's camp, but arrives after she's left.  Now that Marge knows the truth Homer hopes for her forgiveness.  She doesn't believe he really cared all those years ago, until he pulls the other piece of her broken heart out of his memory box.

                            <p>It's shot day and Bart tries to evade the needle.  Dr. Hibbert manages to get the job done but Bart suffers a side effect of temporary hearing loss from the shot and he takes advantage of it for all it's worth.  At Springfield Elementary the annual Donkey basketball tournament is being held.  During the playing of The Star Spangled Banner Bart has his shorts eaten by a donkey, leaving his bare ass exposed towards the flag.  Martin snaps a picture and everyone present is outraged at this behavior.  As a result the Simpson family becomes very unpopular.  They go on a cable news channel and only manage to dig themselves into a deeper hole when the host manages to twist Marge's words into saying that Springfield hates America.  The negative publicity causes Mayor Quimby to change the name of the town to Liberty-Ville and they make everything patriotic.  The family is arrested under violation of the "government knows best act" and they are brought to a reeducation center.  The last registered Democrat tells them how they can escape.  During their musical number they escape through a tunnel but find they were on Alcatraz.  They are rescued by a passing French freighter and taken to France.  After being there a while they decide they miss their life in America and go back as illegal immigrants.

                            <p>Lisa is going to read a poem at the town's celebration of their natural landmark "Geezer Rock," but Homer who believes he is doing the right thing removes a bush from the landmark that causes it to fall apart.  Mr. Burns is caught in the landslide and Smithers fears he is lost.  Lisa is disappointed that no one got to hear her poem and Marge suggests that she get it published.  To Smithers' delight, Mr. Burns has survived the landslide by slithering his way out however; he is annoyed to find out that no one missed him when they thought he was lost.  He decides to buy every media outlet in town.  Lisa distributes the first issue of her own newspaper the "The Red Dress Press," which is a success.  Now she has to get out a second issue and she enlists the help of her fellow children.  Meanwhile, Mr. Burns has taken control of all the media outlets in Springfield, except one, her newspaper.  Mr. Burns tries to seduce Lisa into selling out but she won't give up.  Now Mr. Burns starts to play hardball, he cuts the power to the Simpson home.  Principal Skinner offers Lisa the use of an old mimeograph machine, which gets her latest issue out.  Mr. Burns talks with Homer to get the dirt on Lisa, that Homer readily supplies and Burns uses this information against her.  Lisa is ready to give up and Homer realizing what he's done responds by printing a newspaper of his own.  Homer's paper inspires others to think to begin to think for themselves and soon everyone is printing their own newspaper.

                            <p>Mr. Burns uses his ATM card and gets a $1000 bill.  It hits him in the chest and then blows away, right across town and into the Simpson living room window, where Bart gets a hold of it.  His parents (well Marge anyway) make him put up a notice so that the owner might have a chance to claim the bill.  When no one can identify the bill, Bart wonders what he can do with his new windfall.  He realizes that he can make money showing off his bill, so he opens up the "Museum of Modern Bart" in his tree house.  Mr. Burns makes his claim for the bill, but all is not lost.  Bart has made over $3000 in admissions to his museum.  To make use of the money the family decides to go to England, where Abe recalls having a memorable night with a beautiful English girl named Edwina.  In merry ole England, the Simpsons meet Prime Minister Tony Blair.  Abe tries to find Edwina, meanwhile the rest of the family tours London.  Everything is going fine until Homer slams his rental Mini into the back of the Queen's horse drawn carriage.  Homer is put on trial, makes an ass out of himself in court and is thrown into the Tower of London.  Lisa finds a way for Homer to escape his tower cell, a secret tunnel once used by Sir Walter Raleigh.  Unfortunately the tunnel leads to the Queen's bedroom.  Homer's pathetic plea with the Queen works and the family is allowed to leave the country, provided they take Madonna with them.  Before boarding the plane, Edwina calls out to Abe, and introduces him to her daughter of 58 years, Abbie, a woman who looks like Homer in drag.  Abe runs on board the plane as fast as he can.

                            <p>It is Mother's Day and Homer goes with the kids to Sprawl-Mart to buy Marge a better gift.  They find Abe working there as a greeter and Lisa asks her aunts to help them pick out a gift.  Patty and Selma recommend the Kitchen Carnival, which makes food fun.  Marge likes the gift, which can deep fry, make cotton candy and caramelize anything.  Later that night, Homer creates an 85 lb. sugar ball and he seems to fall in love with his new creation.  Marge insists that he get rid off of the ball, which he takes to the dump.  At the dump he gets attacked by a bear.  He returns home and finds that his attack was covered by the media.  He's been labeled a coward and it begins to affect his life.  Too combat his fear he needs to attack the bear that bested him, and he constructs a bear attack proof suit.  Marge forbids him from using the suit, but he goes anyway.  With help from Lenny, Carl, and Bart, Homer goes out into the woods in search of the bear.  Of course when he actually encounters the bear, he is without the suit.  The bear takes Homer to his cave and Homer removes the tag from the bear that was causing it discomfort.  He bonds with the bear and tries to keep it from being hunted.  He lends the bear his bear proof suit and it helps to get him to the wildlife sanctuary, where the bear is free to be attacked by other animals.

                            <p>It's Christmastime and at the power plant Mr. Burns passes out Christmas bonuses, a $5 dollar voucher to the cafeteria.  For reasons unknown, Mr. Burns gives Homer a "confectioner's card" for Bart featuring a "current baseballer."  The "current baseballer" is Joe DiMaggio and it is his rookie card that Homer brings to the Comic Book Guy, where he gets everything he has in the register for the card.  With this financial windfall, the Simpson family goes Christmas shopping at the Springfield Heights Promenade, where the rich people shop.  Homer spends the remaining portion of his share of the money for a gift for himself (a personalized talking astrolabe) and has no money left to buy the family a nice Christmas tree.  Marge and the kids find out what he's spent the money on and are disappointed in him.  Spending the night on the couch, Homer watches "Mr. McGrew's Christmas Carol" and the story works its magic on Homer, and Homer wakes with resolve to be good and unselfish.  Homer starts helping the less fortunate and his good deeds begin to make Ned Flanders' jealous.  To combat against Homer's good reputation, Ned decides to give everyone in Springfield a Christmas present.  Homer decides to outdo Flanders, but on advice from Lisa and her Buddhist view of the world, Homer decides to take everyone's presents.  Homer and SLH (a la the Grinch) sneak into everyone's home and take all of their presents.  The angry mob finds Homer in downtown Springfield.  Ned tries to come to Homer's rescue, but a "star" in the sky saves them both and they return the presents.  After Moe's failed annual suicide attempt the whole town joins in a rendition of "Hark the Herald Angels Sing."

                            <p>Bart is trying to watch "The Gator Baiter," when Lisa turns the channel to "Dollhouse Do-Overs."  In their ensuing scuffle for the remote, the channel is changed to "Roofi," an entertainer that appeals to very small children.  To get the TV back Bart suggests that Marge buy Maggie a "Roofi" CD, which Lisa tries to warn him against.  The warning doesn't work; Marge fills the house and family car with the sounds of "Roofi," which drives Homer, Bart and Lisa crazy.  Marge takes Maggie to an outdoor "Roofi" concert being held at Cletus's farm.   The concert turns into a disaster and the babies begin to riot.  After paying $1 million in additional taxes to help pay for the damage the babies caused, the single (and other childless) adults of Springfield join SSCCATAGAPP (Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples And Teens And Gays Against Parasitic Parents) and begin to revolt against children.  "Children are the future, today belongs to me."  Marge takes up the cause on behalf of the children and works to get voter sponsored initiative proposition on the ballot.  Marge forms PPASSCCATAG (Proud Parents Against Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples And Teens And Gays).  The tobacco lobby tries to endorse Marge's cause, but she won't take their money; however, Mr. Burns signs her petition and others soon follow.  Her "Families Come First" proposition #242 gets on the ballot.  Homer's attempts to help Marge's initiative, but his kind of help might only hurt it.  Bart and Lisa (well Lisa anyway) come up with a plan to get Marge's prop 242 passed.  It seems the members of SSCCATAGAPP have no immunity against children.

                            <p>Milhouse comes over with a Psycho Cycle bike conversion kit, which they use on Bart's bike to make it look cooler.  While riding the modified bike, they are hassled by older boys with "big boy" bikes.  It makes Bart wish for a ten-speed bike.  To get a new bike Bart sacrifices his old bike right in front of Dr. Hibbert's Mercedes.  As Dr. Hibbert leaves his Mercedes then runs over Snowball II and Lisa is devastated.  Bart and Homer get Bart a new bike, but it needs to be assembled and Homer tries to do his best.  The bike falls apart when Bart tries to show it off to the older boys.  Later Bart and Homer are watching "Robot Rumble" and the father and son teams inspire Homer to try building a robot for them to enter in competition but Bart leads Homer to believe that Bart thinks he is an oaf.  Marge and Lisa look for a new cat and Lisa finds a new one that she calls Snowball III.  Homer tries to build a robot, but his result is a failure.  Homer looks to his father for inspiration and becomes a robot instead of building one.  Bart wakes to find Homer's robot in his room, which is actually Homer inside of large metal shell powered by a tricycle.  Lisa finds that Snowball III has drowned in the fish tank.  Bart competes on "Robot Rumble," with the robot he's called "Chief Knock-A-Homer," but Homer is nowhere to be found.  Homer, hidden inside the robot, manages to win his first match, but only after he receives numerous cuts and bruises.  Lisa gets (and quickly loses) a new cat named Coltrane.  Chief Knock-A-Homer quickly works his way into the finals, but Bart is sorry that his father hasn't been able to see any of the Chief's victories.  The Chief's final match is scheduled to be against Professor Frink and his son's deadly looking robot.  Lisa, depressed about her propensity to kill cats, is surprised when a crazy lady leaves her with a new cat.  Lisa sees that new cat looks kill proof, and decides to call it Snowball II and forgot the whole dead cat thing ever happened.  After the first round of the finals Bart discovers the secret inside of Chief Knock-A-Homer and thinks his dad is even cooler for doing that.  The match is stopped in the second round when Homer's presence in the robot is revealed to everyone.  The law of robotics saves Homer's life and the Frink robot goes out its way to make Homer comfortable.  Nature's greatest killing machine is declared the winner.

Apu and Manjula stop by celebrating their anniversary, making Homer realize he hasn't gotten anything for his anniversary with Marge.  He gets extremely drunk and finds himself ‘dancing' on the street where people, thinking he is homeless, start giving him money.  Milhouse reveals the secret to his new attitude is the fact that he and his mother are moving to Capitol City, where they are going to get a fresh start.  Both Bart and Kirk Van Houten are going to have to learn to get along without Milhouse being around.  Bart tries to adapt to a world without Milhouse, especially after a visit to Milhouse in Capitol City makes him realize that things will never be the same.  In the meantime, Homer has begun begging as a second job when he realizes he can make good money that allows him to buy Marge an expensive anniversary gift.  With Milhouse out of his life, Bart finds himself bonding with his sister and she is enjoying the new relationship with her brother; a relationship that gets tested when Kirk gets "pity custody" of Milhouse and Marge is enlightened by the homeless on Homer's second source of income.

                            <p>The house next door is for sale and Marge and Homer go inside to check it out; Marge falls in love with the kitchen.  Back at home Marge asks Homer for a new kitchen.  Rather than hire someone, Homer decides to do the renovation himself.  While demolishing the kitchen, Homer unleashes his old collection of Playdude magazines.  He tells Marge he keeps them for the articles; she obliges him by cutting up the magazines, keeping only the articles.  Now that they are useless, Homer throws them away, only to have them found by Bart and Milhouse.  Using these 1970's era magazines as a model, Bart decides to renovate the Treehouse.  After Homer has made a mess of the kitchen remodeling, Marge is finally able to hire a contractor, who completes the job "on-time" two years later for $100,000.  Marge's first new dish out of her kitchen gets rave reviews and she decides to enter the Ovenfresh Bakeoff with her Dessert Dogs.  At the bakeoff Marge encounters stiff and ruthless competition, so ruthless that Marge resorts to cheating to get even, much to Lisa's dismay.  Chief Wiggum and other concerned parents talk with Homer about Bart's spreading the Playdude philosophy to the other children.  Homer has a talk with Bart about the facts of life, which a horrified Bart quickly spreads to the other children.  Meantime, in the finals for the bakeoff against Brandine, Marge admits to her foul play and Lisa's faith in her mother is restored.

                            <p>03.) Sleeping with the Enemy</p>
                            <p>Lisa has a big butt and her friends at school, Sherri, Terri and Janie let her know about it.  Homer explains to her about the Simpson butt, it is something she'll have to learn to live with.  Bart comes home with 100 on his test, and now he wants to collect on the party that was promised.  Lisa is trying to deal with her weight issue, meanwhile Bart gets his party; with his relatives, Ralph, Martin and Milhouse via speakerphone.  It's the worst party ever as far as Bart's concerned.  It's made worse when Lisa returns home only to be confronted by her mother wanting her to eat a big slice piece of cake, she runs out of the room crying.  Marge is bummed that the kids don't appreciate her anymore.  She finds Nelson in the park and spends some quality time with him and when her kids continue to shun her, she adopts Nelson as a surrogate child.  Lisa tries diet and exercise to reduce her big bottom.  Marge brings Nelson home to do some chores around their home, but Nelson's real mother returns that money that Marge paid her son and then she leaves for Hollywood, leaving her son in Springfield and homeless.  Nelson goes to the only place where he can find refuge, the Simpson home.  Much to Bart's dismay Marge lets Nelson stay in his room.  Late one night Bart finds Nelson singing for the return of his father and Lisa overindulging in a cake (she'd previously been starving herself).  Lisa gets help from Nelson to get revenge on Sherri and Terri.  When the pair returns to the Simpson home there is a surprise waiting for Nelson; Bart has found his father.  Nelson is reunited with his father (and his mother who's returned from Hollywood with an acting job).  Lisa still hasn't found a conclusive solution to her weight problem.

                            <p>Famous journalist Chloe Talbot comes to Springfield to cover a scandal involving Mayor Quimby.  Chloe Talbot comes from Springfield and she and Marge were journalism students together in high school; Chloe went on to fame and fortune and we all know what happened to Marge.

When Marge won't let her go with Chloe to news conference, Lisa sneaks out and into the trunk of Chloe's car.  Everything might have gone according to plan if Chloe hadn't been diverted to cover the eruption of a volcano.  Lisa and Chloe get into trouble and it takes a mother's love to affect Lisa's rescue, whereas Chloe's rescue comes from an old high school boyfriend, Barney Gumble.

                            <p>Bart loses his last baby tooth in a spitball fight.  Called the money tooth, Bart is suffering from what he calls a midlife crisis when the tooth fairy has given a gift in his name to the United Way, what his mother calls a "grown-up gift."  Bart gives up on his childhood and Lisa suggests that he expresses his feelings in some way and Bart chooses to put them in the form of slogans on a T-shirt.  When Goose Gladwell, a gag-gift entrepreneur, sees the slogans he forms a partnership with Bart that begins to make Bart a lot of money.  Homer is suspended from work without pay and then decides to quit outright and live off of his son's earnings.  Of course he loses his place in the family as breadwinner and starts to lose his self respect.  A documentary by Declan Desmond on lions inspires Homer to start focusing on his relationship with Lisa.  He decides to help her with her science project about nuclear power, which includes a scale model of the first nuclear power plant.  Homer improves on her model by making it functional, something easily done after finding the instructions on the Internet.  He sneaks into the power plant and get some plutonium.  Meanwhile, Goose Gladwell has sold the rights to Bart's T-Shirts to Disney and Bart won't get a dime from it.  To get back into his role as the alpha male of the family, Homer makes use of the working nuclear reactor to threaten Gladwell into giving his son what he deserves and few novelty items for himself.  As to whether the reactor actually works or not, Homer decides to leave that up to the seagulls at the city dump to figure it out.

                            <p>The power plant's office party is being held at the Springfield Air and Space museum, where amongst other things we learn that Agnes Skinner was a wing-walker back in the 1920s.  Mr. Burns is acting unusually nice, and then he makes an announcement that the employee prescription drug program has been canceled.  Other companies follow suit, the citizens of Springfield  
At Springfield Retirement Castle, due to the high cost of medication, they cut their residents off cold turkey.  Grandpa goes to his son's home with a plan; he has a friend that will help them out.  He and Homer go to Canada where they meet the friend that gives them cards that will let them get all the drugs they can carry.  They return home and their drugs are in high demand.  Ned and Apu accompany them on their next trip to Canada, but an unfortunate incident with Apu and a hot cup of coffee gets their cover blown as they try to cross the border.  They are banished from ever returning to Canada.  Because he can no longer afford the medication he requires Smithers' thyroid begins to swell causing a concern for Mr. Burns, he doesn't want to have to train anyone else on his filing system.  He provides the means, his old wooden plane The Plywood Pelican, for Homer to invoke his plan to fly into Canada.  They load up, but on the return flight the plane encounters trouble.  Burns bails out, leaving Homer and Grandpa to crash land the plane in Springfield's town square, where their smuggled drugs are hit.  Meanwhile, Mr. Burns has cured Smithers and decides to reinstitute the drug program for all his full time employees.  Homer comes home from work to report that he is now a freelance consultant, complete with a lump on his throat.

                            <p>The family is celebrating by having brunch at a fancy restaurant; Homer has finally paid off the mortgage.  Lisa and Bart get into a food fight, embarrassing Homer.  Homer goes to Moe's, where a visit from the health inspector, results in his death from eating one of Moe's pickled eggs.  The new health inspector comes down hard and Moe's is closed until the violations are cleared up.  The regulars hold an Irish wake for the demise of Moe's.  Homer decides to help Moe reopen his bar; and he gets a new mortgage for their home.  When Marge finds out, as a new co-owner she goes with Homer to the bar and tells Moe that there are going to be changes until he pays them back.  On Homer's next visit, he finds Marge behind the bar, protecting their investment.  She sends him home to take care of the kids, while she sells Moe on the idea of remodeling the place into an English pub.  The new place opens and is a success; the kids tell Homer that they've noticed that Marge is spending more time at Moe's than he ever did.  Homer becomes worried; but Marge tells him there is nothing to worry about.  They go to a movie together, but they are joined by Moe.  Homer is more worried than ever; Lenny and Carl tell Homer that Marge and Moe are having an emotional affair.  When Marge and Moe are leaving to go to a convention together in Aruba, Homer makes a mad dash to the airport and gets to the airplane as it is taxing down the runaway.  He confronts Moe, but Moe makes him realize that he really doesn't know that much about his wife.  Homer concedes defeat, but Marge tells Moe that she doesn't love him.  She tells Homer that she is totally committed to him.  In Aruba, Marge makes Moe realize that he might be able to make a woman happy some day with a few changes.  Marge realizes that no one is home watching the kids, but the kids aren't at home as Bart has them entered in a European balloon race.

                            <p>The family goes to run down Springfield Park, where a carnival is being held to save it.  Homer performs a wild crowd-pleasing dance at a local carnival, after beating Bart's performance in a game.  Ned Flanders has captured the performance on videotape and Comic Book Guy (Jeff Albertson) puts it up on the Internet.  The video gets worldwide attention, much to Homer's embarrassment but his tune changes when a football player wants to buy the rights to use his dance as his own end zone celebration.  Homer turns the opportunity into a new lucrative occupation, which prospers as other athletes come to learn from him.  Meanwhile Ned looks to create his own wholesome entertainment by creating his own versions of bible stories, which get the backing of Mr. Burns.  Marge doesn't like his approach, which eliminates the good aspects of the stories, and only concentrates on the violence.  She threatens a boycott, which gets Burns to remove his financial backing, leaving Ned with no creative outlet.  The commissioner of football (and all the owners) want to talk to Homer, his teaching of crazy antics to their players have increased their ratings.  They want him to choreograph the Superbowl half-time show.  Homer struggles for a show idea and on the night before the big show he still doesn't have one.  Homer looks for inspiration at the church, but instead finds Flanders, who is looking for an outlet for his ideas.  Together they bring the story of Noah to the half-time show, but everyone boos as no one wanted to see such a "blatant display of religion and decency."

                            <p>Homer's lost the TV remote, which was swallowed by Santa's Little Helper and in the chaos that follows Bart sees a commercial for a rap concert and wants to go.  Bart gets permission from Homer, but when Marge finds out and disapproves, Homer quickly changes his position.  Bart sneaks out and goes to the show anyway.  He is in the front row of the show and when the microphone comes his way he winds up rapping on stage and holding his own.  He gets back home only to find out he is going to be in big trouble; to prevent that he decides to fake his own kidnapping.  The police are on the case; meanwhile Bart finds Milhouse and hides out in his dad's bachelor apartment.  Chief Wiggum decides he needs to do something to improve his reputation as a police officer and puts the clues together to find Bart at Kirk Van Houten's apartment.  Wiggum is hailed as a hero and Milhouse's father is in jail.  Wiggum has been promoted to Police Commissioner but Bart, feeling guilty about getting his friend's father put in jail, comes clean about faking the kidnapping.  Wiggum shows Bart that everyone is better off believing the lie, Milhouse's dad is being worshipped by prisoner loving woman and he gets three square meals a day.  Back at the house, Lisa has found a clue that proves Bart wasn't kidnapped.  She tries to tell Homer, but he has sold the story to Hollywood.  Lisa goes to Principal Skinner for help and the pair begins an investigation that will unravel the lie that is benefiting everyone.  Bart takes the other conspirators to rapper Alcatraz's crib to prevent Lisa and Skinner from finding the truth.  They arrive too late, only to find out that they know the truth.  Bart and Homer try to convince Lisa to be cool about living the lie and a house party ensues.

                            <p>Bart and Milhouse look for someone new to play tricks on and they find their new victim in Howell Huser, a yokel who just fell of the turnip truck.  Their pranks get Howell Huser to stop smiling and he leaves town, only to turn up on the Soft News Network reporting that Springfield is the only town he's been to that he doesn't like.  The negative publicity affects tourism.  Mayor Quimby calls for the town to give him ideas to promote tourism and Lisa suggests they start allowing same sex marriages.  The idea is approved and Springfield becomes the place to be for same sex couples to get married.  When Reverend Lovejoy won't perform the ceremonies, Homer can't pass up the opportunity to make money and he becomes a certified minister via the Internet.  He marries all the gay couples in town and then starts to marry anything to anything else.  Patty requires Homer's service; she wants to marry her partner, Veronica, who is a pro-golfer.  Marge has trouble dealing with the fact that her sister is gay.  Marge discovers Veronica's secret, that she is really a man.  Marge stops the wedding and reveals the secret, and when Leslie Robin Swisher (Veronica's real name) proposes that they still get married, she sticks to her guns, she still likes only girls.

Lisa (of course) blames global warming. While Lisa is calling for action to save the glacier, her brother is taking every opportunity to torment her.

Meanwhile, back in town Homer and Marge have gone to Sprawl Mart to do some shopping.  When Grampa (Sprawl Mart's greeter) isn't capable of doing his job, Homer takes over and does such a great job it gets him a full time position with no chance for advancement. 

Lisa has vengeance on Bart by getting a restraining order against him, he must stay at least 20 feet away from her at all times, or go to jail.  Chief Wiggum shows the family a videotape hosted by Gary Busey on how to live with a restraining order.  For his part Homer constructs a 20 foot pole that Lisa can use to help keep them apart. 

It impacts Bart's life at home and school.  At family court, after Bart points out some obvious flaws in her character, Judge Harm increases the distance to 200 feet.  Having to live at the edge of their property, Bart decides to embrace living the natural way.

Homer finds out from his fellow employees how to survive working at Sprawl Mart.  And mistakenly feeling that Bart might have changed, Lisa decides to forgive him and burn up the restraining order.

Fearing that with no insurance for Homer they will go broke, Marge starts cost-cutting measures.  Homer is against these new measures and takes the nest egg that Marge has made and spends it on the down payment for a new motor home.  Marge tells him to enjoy being the king of his new castle, because she is no longer speaking to him.  Homer is now living in the RV in the backyard and he and Marge try to entice Bart and Lisa to come and stay with them.  Homer then opens up the backyard as a RV park, until Marge puts an end to it and they get into a big fight, which makes Bart and Lisa take action.  Bart decides they need to take the RV back to the dealer.  Homer and Marge try to stop the pair who has managed to get the RV onto the freeway.  The RV crashes onto a Turkish container ship, which is leaving port.  With the right enticement, mushroom soup, Marge gets the ship to turn around, saving the children and what is left of the RV.

                            <p>The family visits Shelbyville and are appalled at the perception those citizens have of the inhabitants of Springfield.  Back in town, Marge brings it to the attention of the Springfield Cultural Advisory Board and then asks architect Frank Gehry to design and build a new Springfield cultural center.  He sees inspiration in her request and submits a design that is approved by the town.  $30 million dollars later, the project is built and it opens and closes quickly as nobody in town really cares for classical music.  Mr. Burns agree to take over the space, with his plan to turn it into a state prison.  Homer applies for a job as a guard, but fails the drug test after Otto switches their samples.  Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa follow Snowball II, when they believe the reason she is so fat is that she is getting food from elsewhere; after following her they discover she has another family.  Burns needs convicts for his prison and Chief Wiggum blows the dust of some old forgotten laws.  Homer is arrested for illegally transporting litter (kicking a can 5 times in a row).  In prison Homer inadvertently squeals on Snake's escape attempt and is drafted to becoming a snitch and he begins enjoy the perks that go along with it.  Snowball II ("Smoky") enjoys life with her new family and Bart gets into the home to find out; there is plenty of good eating to be found there.  Fat Tony and his boys try to find out who the snitch is.  They feed Homer information regarding a breakout.  While all the guards are outside waiting for the breakout, the prisoners are taking care of their snitch and a riot ensues.  The riot is stopped and Homer snitches on the conditions of the prison.

                            <p>Springfield is experiencing an unusually strong thunderstorm, and the rain is causing roofs to leak all over town.  Homer devises a unique solution for getting the rain water out of their house that ultimately fails and sends him dejected off to Moe's, where he ruins Lenny's surprise party.  Homer goes off wandering and finds himself at a bar called Knockers, where he makes a new friend named Ray, who is a licensed and bonded roofer.  Marge takes the kids on some errands while Homer and Ray almost begin the roof repairs; they screw around and never get around to doing any work until he gets called away.  Marge wants Homer to fix the roof by himself.  Homer runs into Ray at the Builder's Barn and Ray promises to stop by later and help him with the roof.  Homer waits for him, but Marge is skeptical that Ray even exists when Ray never shows up.  Marge has Homer placed in the mental ward of the hospital and she and no one else can confirm that Ray really exists.  Dr. Hibbert recommends and gives Homer electro-shock therapy.  Six weeks later Homer's treatments are over and to everyone's surprise Ray turns up at the hospital to celebrate Homer's release.  Plausible explanations, even one by Stephen Hawking, are given to explain why no one had ever seen Ray before.

                            <p>At Springfield Elementary the new vending machine contract is awarded to a company that promises to give half the profits to the school and it is of little consequence whether the snacks are healthy for the children or not.  Bart begins taking all of his meals from the vending machine and three weeks later has gained a lot of weight, so much so that he has heart attack symptoms as a result.  The X-Ray shows that malted milk balls have blocked his arteries.  Despite it all Bart continues to eat junk food.  Marge has no choice and holds an intervention, which Bart escapes from, right into the hands of representatives of a maximum security fat camp who take him away.  Bart finds himself Serenity Ranch with Kent Brockman, Apu and Rainer Wolfcastle.  The first bill from the ranch arrives and Marge decides they need to find a way to pay for it.  They open their house up as youth hostel to German tourists.  Having a hard time getting through to Bart, Tab Spangler takes him home and shows the horrors his family is enduring on his behalf.  Bart finally gets the message and rages against the vending machines and is cured of his junk food addiction, there are three non-refundable weeks of fat camp available for a family member to use. Homer, the obvious choice, is elected to go.

                            <p>Bart and Lisa want to start getting their hair cut at the mall.  They go to the mall with Homer and while getting their haircut they get into a fight, which results in them each getting really bad haircuts.  Out in the mall they are spotted by fellow school students who have cameras in hand.  They find Homer and go on the run; they sneak into the back entrance of a movie theater and see the film "Left Below," which is a movie about the apocalypse.  The images in the movie are disturbing to Homer, who fears the worst.  Marge assures him that there needs to be some ominous signs before the rapture will come.  When Homer is out driving, he sees what he believes to be the signs.  Homer gathers some books on the subject and he calculates that the "rapture is nigh" at 3:15 PM on May 18th, seven days from now.  He starts to spread the word and tells everyone on television a passage from Revelations 6:13 that says before the rapture "the stars will fall to Earth."  At the Springfield Stadium, there is a celebrity filled blimp accident that causes the stars on board to fall to the Earth and Homer gains instant credibility.  He gets a bus full of people to join him at Springfield Mesa.  When the appointed time comes and goes, Homer loses credibility and everyone return back to their normal lives.  Homer later realizes that he made a mistake in his calculation and the new time is only 30 minutes away.  When no one in his family will join him Homer goes to the Mesa on his own.  The rapture comes and Homer goes to heaven, but despite all that heaven has to offer, Homer needs his family.  He gets an audience with God, but when God won't grant his request to have his family join him; Homer begins raising hell in heaven.  To put a stop to it, God agrees to turn back time and put off the rapture.

At Christmastime while awaiting rescue, Burns, anxious to shoot at something, shoots down Santa Claus.  Abe and Burns help Santa to rebuild his sleigh (only for Burns to later steal.)  After Abe gets it back, Santa promises to come back for a follow-up rescue, but never does.  After Abe has finished relating the story to the kids, Santa makes his overdue appearance and takes Abe to Tahiti to be reunited with his brother.

The kids at Springfield Elementary perform “Perhaps the worst version ever” rendition of “The Nutcracker” ballet according to Superintendent Chalmers.  When it is revealed that you don’t have to pay for the music rights it leads to a montage of citizens of Springfield going about their usual Christmas activities to the more familiar pieces of music from “The Nutcracker,” including a sequence where Moe tries to kill himself, and Homer (forgetting as usual) tries to get Marge her present at the last minute.

                            <p>The result of Marge's anger against Quimby’s new toll road leads to the discovery of a frozen mailman and his 40-year-old mail. The old mail is delivered to the recipients, including one to Grampa Simpson's deceased wife, and it reveals a secret love affair and who the real father of her baby Homer might be.  Confused and emotional, Homer finds Mason Fairbanks, his wealthy and much improved paternal dad, and happily establishes a father-son relationship with him while rejecting Abe, his surrogate father of 40 years, especially after a DNA test reveals that Mason is indeed his real father.  Homer joins Mason on an undersea treasure hunt and when Homer’s life is in mortal danger he reflects upon his childhood and realizes who his true father is.  When he confesses that to Abe, Abe has a confession of his own.

                            <p>16.) The Greatest Story Ever D'ohed</p>
                            <p>When Homer is playing noisily in the yard, it disrupts Flanders' bible-study group. Coaxed by the reverend, a frustrated Flanders takes it upon himself to redeem Homer by inviting the Simpson family on his church retreat to Jerusalem. Unappreciative of the history and culture, Homer would rather hang out at the hotel's breakfast buffet rather than tour the city. But when an eccentric tour guide takes the group to famous monuments, including the Dome of the Rock and the Wailing Wall, Homer finally proves he is not beyond salvation.</p>

                            <p>When the police are called to diffuse a rowdy crowd at Mr. Burns' estate, one of the officers recognizes priceless stolen paintings on the walls, and the maniacal billionaire is taken downtown for questioning. With Mr. Burns gone, Smithers takes charge of the power plant. But when employees take advantage of his good nature, he exacts revenge by forcing the employees to work night and day. These unfair working conditions prompt Homer and his crew to devise a plan to bust out Mr. Burns.</p>

Who is behind the spate of sheep rustling and will they come quietly? But most importantly, can Wallace find a cure for his cheese fetish before he finally goes crackers?</p>

                            <p>04.) A Matter of Loaf and Death</p>
                            <p>When a local baker is murdered, it comes to the attention of the local media that there is a serial killer on the loose, as twelve bakers have been murdered in total. Reported as a "cereal killer" [sic] on the front page of the newspaper. Meanwhile, Wallace and Gromit have opened a bread making business, "Top Bun", and have begun a "Dough to Door" delivery service, where on a morning basis the duo deliver bread to peoples' houses. One morning whilst going on the usual route, they almost run over a fat lady and her dog on a bicycle. Realising that this is the "Bake-O-Lite"[7] lady Piella Bakewell, a former pin-up girl for the bread company, Wallace falls head over heels in love. Suddenly, as she disappears out of the view of the van rear vision mirror, her brakes fail and Wallace and Gromit have no choice but to help her.

The van does a U-turn and chases after Piella. Wallace proceeds to scale the front of the moving van, (which is now moving at the same speed as the bicycle) in the manner of Spider-Man[citation needed]; and straddles the bicycle's front forks. The duo then use fruit buns as brakes between Wallace's knees to slow the bike. However, the bike stops inside the local zoo next to the crocodile pit. Wallace, Gromit, Piella and her dog Fluffles are catapulted into the air, almost landing inside a crocodile's mouth, but are saved by a quick-thinking Gromit who jams the mouth of the croc open with a bread stick and saves Fluffles. Gromit then checks the bike's brakes and seeing that they are working just fine, becomes somewhat suspicious.

Wallace and Piella enter into a whirlwind romance, until Gromit discovers Piella's identity as the serial killer. Wallace, however, is too starry-eyed to pay attention to Gromit's concerns, announcing that he and Piella are engaged to be married. Gromit tries all kinds of tactics to thwart Piella going so far as to install an airport-style metal detector in their home. Piella almost succeeds at pushing Wallace to his death into the mechanisms of the machine - Gromit is chained and unable to help him - but she is hit by a bag of flour (which can only have been launched by Fluffles). She is covered in flour from head to foot, and knocked down the stairs, prompting an angry outburst against bakers and results in her leaving grabbing Fluffles with some malice. Wallace and Gromit return home and Wallace laments the end of his romance with Piella. A short time later, however, Piella appears at the door carrying a large box, which contains a cake. She instructs Wallace to light the candle at four o'clock for a surprise, then makes an excuse and leaves, after telling Gromit that Fluffles is "not well".

Gromit follows Piella home to see what has happened to Fluffles, but is caught and imprisoned with Fluffles in the store room. The two dogs manage to escape in Piella's hot air balloon, and arrive at Wallace's house just as Wallace is lighting the candle on the cake. Gromit attempts to extinguish the wick, only to discover it is a relighting candle. In the resulting struggle between Wallace and Gromit the cake falls to the floor, revealing a bomb underneath. Gromit then attempts to dispose of the bomb, but is thwarted when the places he seeks to dispose of it are occupied by a group of ducks and a pair of nuns carrying kittens, in a scene which references Batman (1966 film).

Gromit tries to throw the bomb out of the house (towards the Yorkshire border) but is hit by a revolving part of a machine, and falls into a vat of dough. The bomb falls out the window, and Piella comes after Wallace with a spanner, exclaiming her pure disdain for baking and her motives behind the serial killings. She is stopped in her tracks by a yellow forklift truck contraption with robot hands covered by oven-mittens, with Fluffles at the wheel. Piella picks up two rolling pins and swings them around her head like nunchucks, then tries to attack the machine (in a parody of the climactic scene of Aliens), all the while Fluffles stopping her blows with the mitts, knocking Wallace straight through the wall by a fierce blow in the process. Wallace and the bomb, which are now caught on the revolving windmill, both fall into the house, and Gromit manages to get himself out of the dough.

As the fight ensues, Piella is pushed closer and closer to the edge of the house until Wallace arrives making a remark about the bomb. This is all the time Piella needs as a distraction and she leaps onto the balloon for safety. It is revealed that the bomb is inside Wallace's trousers, and the two dogs desperately use dough pressure to try to equalise the force of the forthcoming explosion. Due to her weight, the balloon can't support Piella, and she comes crashing down into the crocodile pit in the zoo, only to be eaten. This is the first death of a human villain to occur in a Wallace and Gromit film. The balloon (liberated from the overweight Piella) rises up into the clouds where Piella's ghost is briefly visible as her once-thin self; she says goodbye to Wallace with a wave while holding a plate with a loaf of Bake-O-Lite bread.

After the climax Wallace and Gromit decide to deliver some bread in order to take their minds off the gloomy turn of events and almost run over Fluffles who is waiting in the driveway. They see she is sad at losing her owner so they let her hop in the van to join them on their deliveries and all three drive off into the sunset as the song "Puppy Love" plays on the van's stereo.

                            <p>01.) The Original</p>
                            <p>As another day of fantasy plays out in Westworld — a vast, remote park where guests pay top dollar to share wild-west adventures with android “hosts” — top programmer Bernard Lowe alerts park founder Dr. Robert Ford about incidents of aberrant behavior cropping up in some recently re-coded hosts. Meanwhile, in the Westworld town of Sweetwater, a rancher’s daughter named Dolores encounters a gunslinger named Teddy in the street — but their predictable narrative is upended by the appearance of a ruthless Man in Black and, later, by a supporting host’s unscripted encounter with an artifact of the outside world.</p>

Bernard  and Quality Assurance head Theresa Cullen debate whether a recent host anomaly is contagious. Meanwhile, behavior engineer Elsie Hughes tweaks the emotions of Maeve, a madam in Sweetwater’s brothel, in order to avoid a recall. Cocky programmer Lee Sizemore pitches his latest narrative to the team, but Dr. Ford has other ideas. The Man in Black conscripts a condemned man, Lawrence, to help him uncover Westworld’s deepest secrets.</p>

                            <p>While Michael and Dwight are out of the office for the day trying to close a deal on a new condo for Michael, Jim and Pam arrange for the staff to participate in an ""Office Olympics,"" where the workers play strange, invented games (among them, Dunderball, Hate Ball...and Pam Pong) that they usually play while the boss is out.  At the end of the day, the festivities cheer up everyone - even the oblivious Michael.</p>

                            <p>The Office is forced into the parking lot for the day when a fire starts in the kitchen.  To ease everyone's boredom, Jim suggests a game of ""Desert Island"" and ""Who Would You Do?,"" where certain staff members reveal a little too much information about themselves. Throughout the day, Michael talks business with Ryan, leaving Dwight feeling left out.</p>

                            <p>While everyone else in the office enjoys the spooky Halloween festivities and talks about the staff's costumes, Michael ponders who he should fire when the threat of downsizing becomes a reality and his boss orders him to fire one of his staff.  Meanwhile, Jim and Pam put Dwight's resume on job-searching websites, which may make Michael's job a little easier, and Pam encourages Jim to set his goals higher by applying for a better job, which makes Jim consider his friendship with Pam.</p>

Meanwhile, Pam becomes annoyed at Jim when he gets too physical with her, Ryan updates the emergency contact information on a secret mission, and Michael tantalizes Ryan when the boss gets a hold of Ryan's cell phone number.</p>

                            <p>When Michael and Jan try to nail down a potential new client, Christian, by taking him out to Chili's, Michael surprises everyone with what - or who - he does.  Meanwhile, back at the office, Jim finds a semi-autobiographical script that Michael has written called Threat Level: Midnight, and he, Pam, Kevin, and the rest of the Dunder-Mifflin workers have a great time acting it out.  Later that night, Pam and Jim share their first unofficial date, complete with dinner (a sandwich), candlelight, and Dwight's pathetic fireworks display.</p>

However, Michael focuses more on getting feedback about his relationship with Jan than whether or not the workers are doing their job.  Later, a nervous Michael plans to shuffle through the employee suggestion box to steal exciting ideas for his imminent discussion with Jan about his own performance, but that falls apart when Jan asks to sit in on the discussion.  Meanwhile, Jim and Pam try to keep Dwight under the wrong impression that the day is Friday instead of Thursday.</p>

Meanwhile, Pam believes that the relationship between Dwight and Angela is more than just worker to worker, Jim throws an office BBQ at his house in order to show his roommate the kinds of people he deals with everyday, and Michael, after annoying everyone at his improv classes, crashes Jim's party with a terrible karaoke number.</p>

                            <p>Michael hosts a Christmas party at the office, but somehow manages to decrease the holiday cheer when he changes the arranged secret Santa pairs to a game of "Yankee Swap," where everyone gives their pre-bought presents to a different, random worker.  To boost morale, Michael introduces vodka shots while the others compete for an iPod, Jim hopes that his sentimental present, meant for Pam, doesn't end up with Dwight, and Angela becomes enraged about Michael's party changes.</p>

                            <p>Michael takes the entire Dunder-Mifflin staff on a motivational cruise aboard a party boat on Lake Wallenpaupack, but his planned presentation is bogged down by numerous distractions, including a dance contest, limbo, snorkel shots, and the pushy Captain Jack.  Also, Jim and Katy's relationship hits the rocks as Roy and Pam finally set a wedding date, which does more than disappoint Jim, and by the end of the night, Michael's motivational cruise doesn't go completely to waste when he shares a heart-to-heart with one of the workers.

                            <p>When Michael burns his foot with his George Foreman mini-grill, he requires the entire office staff to work around his new injury.  When the workers aren't so keen on obliging, Michael gets angry and calls in a man in a wheelchair to put out the message that disabled people are people too.  Meanwhile, Dwight acts stranger than usual, acting really nice and helpful towards Pam.  It isn't until the end of the day when everyone realizes that the car accident Dwight was in earlier that day gave him a concussion (but was overshadowed by Michael's dramatization of his own burn), and Jim and Michael immediately take him to the hospital.  Needless to say, Michael doesn't appreciate the extra attention that the doctors and nurses pay Dwight.

                            <p>When Michael slips some sly references about Pam in his conversations with Jim, Jim quickly tries to do damage control to make sure that no one else in the office finds about his crush on Pam, all while slamming himself with regret for ever telling Michael in the first place.  Jim goes to drastic measures, even bonding with Michael at a Hooters restaurant for lunch.  Nonetheless, Jim's efforts do little to keep Michael from revealing the secret, but Jim smooths the situation over with Pam to make it seem like nothing more than a tiny crush in the past.  Meanwhile, Dwight conducts an investigation about Oscar's mysterious absence from work, and what Dwight finds, though it goes way over his head, is surprising.

                            <p>When someone soils the carpet in Michael's office, Michael sees it as a form of hatred towards him and realizes for the first time that not everyone may like him.  Due to the odor of his office, Michael temporarily switches workspaces with Jim, and while there, Michael reminisces of his pre-management days, reliving pranks with Dwight that he and Todd Packer played on the staff.  Meanwhile, Jim realizes why Kelly sits alone in the back of the office as he plays messenger for a childish flirtation between Kelly and Ryan, and Pam tries to cope with the day without Jim to make her laugh.

                            <p>The Dunder-Mifflin staffers join in kindergarten-like festivities for Valentine's Day while Michael heads to New York City for a conference with the corporate heads.  After showing the documenters a tour of his favorite city, Michael accidentally lets slip to the others at the conference that he and Jan hooked up, and he finds himself in hot water when Jan and the new CFO of Dunder-Mifflin hear the story.  Back in Scranton, Pam becomes irked when she discovers that Roy hasn't gotten her anything for Valentine's Day, Dwight struggles to find a gift for Angela, and Kelley talks off Jim's ear about her rather desperate affections for Ryan, who is less than interested.

To prepare for a big convention where he is set to give a speech, Dwight turns to Michael to guide him in his quest to conquer the fear.  Meanwhile, Pam gets wrapped up with wedding plans, but Jim has plans of a different sort: an escape route out of Dunder-Mifflin and Scranton, at least for long enough so that he doesn't have to witness Pam's wedding.  While all of this is happening, the staffers battle it out over control of the thermostat.

Later, Michael takes everyone out to the skating rink to get their minds off of Kevin's possible complications, and Pam and Jim go to the supermarket to pick up some presents for Kevin.</p>
